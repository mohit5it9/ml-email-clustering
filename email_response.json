  "\"Alan Greenspan's outfit is troubled by a research report dated": [
    "Oct.  18To all G7 clients,We are pleased to see that SOMEONE is reading our survey...hope you are too.Best regards,Jane HartleyCEOG7 Group, Inc.CONSUMERS TOO AFRAID TO SPENDBy JOHN CRUDELE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------November 13, 2001 -- CONSUMERS are talking tough and optimistic, but actingweak and glum.That's the big problem in the American economy right now. And things likeyesterday's plane crash - whether caused by terrorism or not - are likely toaggravate that situation.The dual personality being exhibited by Americans is bothering the FederalReserve, whose interest-rate cuts won't be nearly as effective if consumersare too scared to borrow money. I spoke with a source of mine who isfamiliar with the Fed's thinking and he tells me that monetary authoritiesare concerned, as well as perplexed, by consumers' unwillingness to partwith a dollar even as they are feigning confidence.In particular, Alan Greenspan's outfit is troubled by a research reportdated Oct. 18 that was conducted by an independent Washington outfit calledG7 Group. The group had the Princeton Survey Research Associates interview1,045 adults between Oct. 8 and 10.This poll was given to me by someone close to the Fed.The survey found that post-Sept. 11, Americans were putting on a good front.For instance, 66 percent of the people polled said that now is a \"good time\"to purchase a car or a house, but 63 percent said they \"did not feel like\"making a major purchase.Only 41 percent of the respondents felt like shopping for clothes and 75percent felt comfortable buying only necessities like groceries.Consumer confidence has been dropping since before the Sept. 11 terroristattacks. But the current level of confidence could be greatly overstatedbecause it measures what people are saying and not what they are doing.And the Princeton Survey shows that consumers are talking a good game butbuckling when it comes to taking an economic turn at the plate.Not surprisingly, job security is the chief concern, although Americansrefuse to admit it. Even though the U.S. lost 415,000 jobs last month andour unemployment rate jumped sharply to 5.4 percent, more than 70 percent ofthose surveyed said they felt the same or more optimistic than they did afew months ago.The Fed cut interest rates for the tenth time last week. Another rate cut isexpected in December. The Fed made an even bolder move two weeks ago when itannounced that it was going to stop selling 30-year government bonds.The result was that interest rates on long bonds came down sharply, puttingthem more in proportion with recent rate reductions. As I've said inprevious columns, the long bond has been a nuisance for the Central Bankbecause it hasn't declined as much as expected. This has caused things likemortgage rates to remain higher than they could have been.The G7/Princeton survey explains to the Fed why its interest rate strategyhasn't been working. But it doesn't necessarily explain why - as thesurveyors concluded - \"the Sept. 11 attacks opened a chasm between whatAmericans are thinking rationally about the economy and what Americans arefeeling as they now confront economic decisions.\"What will yesterday's incident do to confidence?That's anyone's guess. But unless the government quickly explains whathappened to the public - and that's unlikely in a crash investigation likethis - then Americans are likely to keep up their tough facade while beingweak in the knees.Over the last decade America's mood has depended a lot on how Wall Streetwas feeling. The stock market dipped sharply right after yesterday's planecrash, but snapped back.The Federal Reserve figures, I'm told, that if interest rates stay down andthe stock market remains stable, then Americans will eventually regain theirconfidence.Let's hope so. But if you are investing in a stock market that is thisoverpriced, you should understand that the risks are great. And they aregetting greater.-John Crudele, NY Post, November 13,2001"

Comments are due on June 27.  Unless youtell us otherwise, we plan to file and seek expedited treatment. (The CPUChas no required timetable in which to respond.)  We expect the CPUC toapprove them -- there is pressure from many fronts to DO something about loadparticipation in the market.  Both have asked for a July 17 effective date.SCE's is a much better document and makes a good case for CPUC approval, eventhough the the customers are already benefitting from providing the utilitieswith the option to curtail during system emergencies. SCE proposes thedirects SCE to activate its load curtailment program during the time periodthat the customer has an accepted bid from the ISO in the A/S market, SCE --working with the ISO -- will adjust the customer's bill to avoid doublepayments.  SCE provides no more information, but, on principal, this seemsfair to me.  We'll have to watch to see what the proposed procedure would be.PG&E doesn't say much except that it is \"unable\" to offer this to bundledcustomers (oh, gee -- must be more of those \"system constraints\") until\"later\" (unspecified).  I would expect large customer groups to argue aboutthat -- but it gives us the opportunity to push direct access.  PG&E didn'thave much to offer on the \"double-billing\" issue -- it said either PG&E couldchange the customers bill or the ISO could adjust its payment.FERC threw out all the protests by various parties (e.g., MWD, M-S-R, otherimproper allocation of demand relief program costs (ISO allocates it to allSCs based on metered demand during all hours of the program);q request tocharge those who are out of balance for most of the costs; the need to filepro forma agreement in advance (FERC said ISO doesn't have to); and thesupposed overly restrictive program participation.

    "PM ---------------------------Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff Richter/HOU/ECT@ECT---------------------------Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.*DJ Calif. PUC Approves Utilities Buying Pwr Out Of CalPXMandatory Buy Requirement Ends For UtilitiesLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Public Utilities Commissionapproved a controversial plan Thursday morning thatwill allow the state's three investor-owned utilities to buy power outsidethe Caliifornia Power Exchange market structure.The commission voted 3 to 2 in favor of the measure. Commissioners HenryDuque, Richard A. Bilas and Josiah Neeper votedin favor of the draft order.The decision relieves the three investor-owned utilities, Sempra Energyunit San Diego Gas & Electric (SRE), Pacific Gas &Electric (PCG) and Edison International unit Southern California Edison(EIX), from their mandatory buy requirement thatbecame effective in March 1998 when the state moved to a deregulatedcompetitive market. Originally the mandatory buyrequirement was set to end in 2002, when all three utilities recoveredtheir stranded costs.\"This decision is not as earth shattering as it sounds,\" CommissionerBilas, one of the author's of the draft order, said atThursday's meeting. \"I am not criticizing the power exchange. But this willresult in lower prices patched through to bundledcustomers.\"Trading platforms likw Automated Power Exchange and the New York MercantileExchange can now compete directly with theCalPX, which currently controls 85% of the state's wholesale power market.The utilities can buy power from other \"qualifiedexchanges\" through an advice letter process.Utilities Can Trade With Other Exchanges NowCalifornia's big three utilities can buy power outside the CalPX marketstructure immediately, through an advice letter process,which means the utilities have to notify the commission of their intent totrade power with qualified exchanges such as APX,Nymex or Bloomberg.The commission said the exchanges have to offer the same services as theCalPX - forward, daily and monthly trading, andanonymity to prevent self dealing between the buy side and sell side - inorder to meet the criteria for a qualified exchange.Exchanges would also have to be independently owned from the utilities.Enron Online would not meet the criteria for aqualified exchange, commissioners said.The advice letter only needs to be filed once and s merely a formality thatwould not need to be approved by a majority of thecommission.Mark Huffman, PG&E senior attorney for regulatory affairs, told Dow JonesNewswires that his company \"will quickly startlooking at other exchanges and see what's out there. We're going to startthe advice letter process.\"SoCal Edison and SDG&E said they will do the same.Ed Cazalet, chairman and founder of APX, said Thursday's controversialthree-to-two vote in favor of the draft order \"creates atremendous opportunity for APX.\"\"It allows us to bring the benefits of Silicon Valley technology toCalifornia,\" Cazalet said. \"This is really about bringinge-commerce to the market.\"E. Jesus Arredondo, however, disagreed, saying \"selling into our marketdoesn't cost anything and selling into the APX marketcosts 20 cents per megawatt-hour.\"Commissioner said having other exchanges will not only result in lowerelectricity prices, but it will allow the buyer and sellerthe chance to see prices before making the purchase.CalPX's block forward prices are not immediately published, CommissionerBilas said.Reacting to the ruling, CalPX Chief Executive Officer George Sladoje said\"Today's split vote by the CPUC in favor ofaccelerating the introduction of other qualified exchanges is notwell-reasoned and it may in the end prove counterproductive.\"-By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires (323) 658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.com Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones &Company IncG_nther A.

Ratepayers there are payingmarket-based rates forelectricity and have seen their utility bills nearly triple in the past twomonths.The price cap would need to be approved by the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission before it goesinto effect at the Power Exchange.

The 1999 Beaucastel Chateauneuf du Pape is a profoundly rich=, concentrated, classic vin de garde.  Made from 30% Grenache, 30% Mourvedr=e, 10% Syrah, 10% Counoise, and the remainder a blend of other varietals, i=t is one of the blackest, most opaque-colored Beaucastels of the last decad=e.  The bouquet offers aromas of licorice, roasted meats, black cherry and =blackberry fruit, and a truffle-like earthy note.  Broodingly backward, for=midable endowed, powerful, and extremely tannic, it will require 8-10 years=of cellaring, and should age effortlessly for three decades or more.  Fran=cois Perrin compares it to the thrilling 1990, but at this stage, it appear=s to me to be more structured and closed than the 1990 was at a similar age=.  In any event, it is a great wine, but readers older than 55 should think=twice before investing in such a backward vintage.\"Have your own tasting n=otes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com!=202. #12285 - Beaucastel 1999 Chateauneuf Du Pape White - $47.99 On Sale =2091 Points - Robert Parker\"Beaucastel`s 1999 Chateauneuf de Pape blanc is a terrific success, not sur=prising in view of the fact that all recent vintages have been gorgeous.  I=t is made from 80% Roussanne and 20% Grenache Blanc, fermented in 80% cuves=and 20% barrels, of which 10% are new, and bottled with minimal clarificat=ion.  Like a top Hermitage, the Perrins subscribe to the theory (and I tend=to agree) that this is a wine to drink during its first 2-4 years of life,=or forget it for at least a decade.  It takes on an oxidized mid-life cris=is between 5-10 years of age, and re-emerges as a completely different anim=al around age ten.  Of course, each vintage has its own track record, but i=t is a fascinating wine to drink young, as well as an impressive one to hav=e after ten years.  The light gold-colored 1999 reveals intense marmalade a=nd rose petal, honeyed richness with a touch of spice and toast.  Thick and=unctuously-textured, but supported by excellent acidity, it can be drunk o=ver the next 4! -5 years, and then ignored for a decade.

The Dignus is also one of the best wines to serve with a variety of different foods.  If you are a fan of Bordeaux, you may find this as a great example of that type of wine for a much better price.

All rights reserved=20The oil hedging business is poised to take another step up the evolutionary=ladder, after the upstart IntercontinentalExchange(ICE) confirmed plans to=offer clearing services for its over-the-counter contracts from the fourth=quarter of this year. With similar moves also planned by the New York Merc=antile Exchange (Nymex), OTC contracts such as swaps are increasingly movin=g into the mainstream. Long regarded as the wild cousins of regulated futur=es, OTC oil contracts were distinguished by their fuzzy legal status, lack =of standardization, and absence of clearing services. Changes in USlaw and =the spread of electronic trade have pretty much eroded the first two differ=ences, and the ICE initiative will deal with the third. The main difference=s now lie in regulation and settlement (40#02-06). ICE'sclearing services w=ill be provided by the London Clearing House (LCH) - the clearinghouse for =London's International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), which was taken over by IC=E last month. ICE will now be able to offer a one-stop hedging shop for cle=ared futures and derivative contracts, allowing traders to use a single loc=ation to conduct full hedging strategies and to pool their risk. One advant=age is that it will allow net margining between IPE Brent futures and other=ICE products, such as West Texas Intermediate swaps. Clearinghouses offer =financial risk protection, acting as a central party to shield traders agai=nst counterparty default. Derivatives trade at ICE is currently conducted b=etween companies on the basis of bilateral credit agreements.=20ICE'sinitiative in part reflects its increasingly fierce competition with N=ymex. The New Yorkexchange will this week launch its new Brent crude future=s and options contracts, as a direct challenge to the merged ICE-IPE (40#35=-04). In return, ICE will first introduce clearing services for two activel=y traded USproducts, involving West Texas Intermediate crude oil swaps and =Henry Hub natural gas swaps. These swaps are the planned centerpiece for Ny=mex'slong-delayed internet platform, eNymex(40#04-05). They also pose a pot=ential challenge to Nymex'stwo core futures contracts, if trade migrates to=swaps. Some traders view swaps as more effective hedging tools. Calendar-m=onth WTI swaps, for example, are widely used to hedge against producer or r=efiner supply contracts, which use average prices during calendar rather th=an contract months.=20The evolution of swaps is also part of a deeper market trend, which has bee=n actively encouraged by the USgovernment and some big energy companies. Th=e UShas been working to give derivatives a stronger legal framework since t=he late 1990s, after Russiadefaulted on its debt and the Long-Term Capital =Management hedge fund came to the brink of collapse. That effort culminated=in legislation late last year giving derivatives a stronger legal footing,=thus eliminating the chance that parties might renege on unfavorable contr=acts by claiming they were really unauthorized futures deals. The spread of=electronic trade - particularly on ICE - has accelerated the change, by en=couraging liquid trade in standardized products. This is no accident. In an=interview with PIW a year ago, John Browne, chief executive of BP - one of=ICE'sfounders - said that the platform had been set up in an attempt to cr=eate \"a real exchange market for swaps, rather than simply one-off, over-th=e-counter activity.\" This would make hedging more transparent and efficient=, while eroding the role of intermediaries, he said. Browne drew parallels =with the earlier evolution of interest-rate swaps in financial markets, int=o \"a standardized business.\" (39#27-08).Last week, ICE Chief Executive Jeff=rey Sprechersaid the exchange wants \"to try to change the way the market wo=rks.\""

I talked to Cheerie and she said the person in Dallas is trying to=get it done today, however, she may not finish it out today, which means i=t will be sent for Thursday morning delivery to a sister Ticor office for s=ignature and recording.  Have they told you any of this? Or do I need to ma=ke sure you know when, where, and how as soon as I know.I talked to Andrew this morning the Dallas office received the Appraisal an=d gave the information to us over the phone.  The appraised value as built =is 12.5 million, the NOI is $1,152,695.  The problem is the Land Value is $=1,120,000, as this is what they have recorded as the transaction cost in Ja=nuary.  Andrew talked to me about if we want to put additional costs on top=of this showing improvements or other costs associated with the value to s=how an increase in value?.  I am tending to think we are going to reduce ou=r overall loan by adjusting the Land, Title Policy Amount, Debt Carry Cost =and some other small adjustments to costs. This would reduce our overall de=bt and resultant equity requirement. The main difference in committing to a=greater loan is that our costs of points will rise and our equity may be o=ut of balance in the end, vs. if we borrow the exact amount, we may risk be=ing short and needing a loan increase for any soft cost overages. I have be=en working on this and I am reviewing the changes to see what overall effec=ts each change will have on your equity and return.We are firm on the construction numbers given to you previously and we have=had a number of additional costs which we have been able to absorb in the =overall construction budget.  The biggest is the detention pond dredging wh=ich has gone up in cost.  The only area left to work through is the foundat=ion/concrete number and I am confident we will hit that one on the mark. Th=us, overall I am comfortable with the Hard Cost numbers at this point.I am attempting to get with Irwin and Cheerie and seeing if we can get the =final Doc's put together.

Any possibility for a=deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic=ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc=us is reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic=ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o=nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double=dip\" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=islature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th=e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac=e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=hat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in =breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=e bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi=ll be very difficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=e would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =$8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this =concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful=l disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the =details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=will support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=ll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=k of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=r community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre=ntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get =paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20=20According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic=ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 =of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ=icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo=rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.=20Key Points of the Bridge Financing=09=09=09Lehman Brothers=09=09$1.0 B=09=09=09Bear Stearns=09=09$625 M=09=09=09Tax-Exempt Rate=09=094.77%Current Projected=20For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t=he California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz=ations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is =that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=ing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=ier in the crisis.=20SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the =governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t=o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s=igned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi=s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat=es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is=suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s=tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th=en the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st=ate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p=assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=the DWR proportionately from rate payments."

Silicon Valley may be power=less and profitless, but Houston, the nation's energy capital and home to t=he oil-baron excesses of the 1980s, is back in \"bidness.\" The energy giants=in Texas have big fat wallets these days--and even bigger construction pla=ns. Not since the boom days of 1982, when trophy architects like Philip Joh=nson and I.M. Pei reconfigured the skyline, has Houston seen so much constr=uction activity by the energy sector.  Leading the parade, ironically, is E=nron, an old energy behemoth that has reinvented itself as a high-tech trad=ing firm dealing in everything from natural gas to Internet bandwidth. In f=act, its new 40-story headquarters, designed by Cesar Pelli, will be fronte=d by a seven-story \"podium\"--or shorter building--to house what Enron is ca=lling the largest commodities-trading environment in the world.  This envir=onment, spread over four floors, each the size of a city block, will become=home this August to 2,000 employees trading commodities that range from Ol=d World (crude oil, petrochemicals, steel and lumber) to New World (emissio=n credits and derivatives). Chairman Kenneth Lay and CEO Jeff Skilling are =even moving from their skyboxes to work in seventh-floor offices so they ca=n peer down into the pit.  When the bigger 40-story structure is finished i=n December, Enron's will be the first new skyscraper in downtown Houston si=nce 1987--to be followed by three more by 2003. Besides Enron, Calpine Corp=., the nation's leading independent-power company, based in California, wil=l move into a new 32-story high-rise. And Reliant Resources, the IPO spun o=ff this month from its Houston parent to deal with Texas' new deregulated e=lectricity market, has signed on for offices in a 36-story skyscraper.  Wha=er revenues were up 281%, while Calpine's revenues and net income were each=up more than 400%--even with California's deadbeat utility PG&E owing the =company more than $300 million.  After a decade of contraction in the busin=ess, with companies having shut offices from New Orleans to Oklahoma, dereg=ulation and new marketing strategies are sparking Houston's renaissance. \"E=nron is a leading example of the new energy industry. Ten years ago, there =were no trading floors,\" points out Stephen Brown, senior economist with th=e Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas. Both Calpine and Reliant will also have t=rading operations in their new offices.  Though Houston no longer relies so=heavily on the energy business (down to 48% of the local economy from 82% =in 1982) the turnaround sure feels good after the city lost more than 15,00=0 energy-sector jobs two years ago, says Barton Smith, director of the Inst=itute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston. It has gained =Houston afloat while the rest of the country is suffering.\"  None of this =matters to real Houston lovers, of course. They're just interested in bragg=ing rights. After a bad decade, they're beginning to sound like the biggest=and the best in Texas again. \"Boomlet?\" says Laura Schwartz, spokeswoman a=t Enron. \"It's more than a mini-boom.

    "businessGood Morning,Samantha asked me to check her email for items that appear to need resoluti=on and send them to the ladies of the SWAP group.  If I may be of any assis=tance, please don't hesitate to contact me at 53317.  I am not sure if this=item needs immediate attention or not.  Thank you!KeeganSamantha M. BoydSenior Legal SpecialistEnron Wholesale Services1400 Smith Street, EB3803Houston, Texas 77002-----Original Message-----ssOn October 11, Mirant Canada Energy Marketing Ltd. purchased a substantial =portion of TransCanada Pipeline's trading and marketing business. As a resu=lt, Mirant will be purchasing the entire business of TransCanada Energy Fin=ancial Products Limited, and will be taking assignment of the physical gas =transactions/contracts of TransCanada Gas Services Inc. and TransCanada Gas=Services, a division of TransCanada Energy Ltd.As a result of this transaction, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. will be termina=ting whatever credit support they provided for these entities and that cred=it support will be picked up by Mirant Corp, depending on the arrangements =that we have negotiated. With respect to TransCanada Energy Financial Produ=cts Limited, it was agreed that the ISDA that is currently between Enron Ca=nada Corp. and TransCanada Energy Financial Products Limited will be assign=ed to Mirant Canada Energy Marketing Ltd under the same credit terms as cur=rently exist.  Mirant Corp will issue a $30 million USD guaranty to provide=the credit support for this document, the same dollar amount that TransCan=ada Pipelines Ltd was providing.  They have also agreed to provide whatever=necessary collateral to cover their exposure, over the threshold, as a res=ult of their purchasing this entity.With respect to TransCanada Gas Services Inc., the only outstanding gas tra=nsactions are with Enron North America and these all relate to physical pro=duct. There is no contract between TransCanada Gas Services Inc. and Enron =North America, but TCPL is currently providing a guaranty for this business=. This guaranty will be terminated, and these transactions will be covered =under a current Mirant Corp guaranty covering Mirant Canada Energy Marketin=g Ltd. for physical gas transactions with Enron North America. This current=guaranty is for USD $10 million and is of a sufficient amount to cover the=current exposure as well as the exposure being brought over from TransCana=da Gas Services Inc..Finally, with respect to TransCanada Gas Services, a division of TransCanad=a Energy Ltd, there is currently a physical gas master with Enron Canada Co=rp. However, this was executed in 1993 and is outdated with respect to cred=it provisions. I have been working with the credit contact at Mirant Canada=to get a new physical master between ECC and Mirant Canada Energy Marketin=g Ltd. This new master would govern all existing trades between ECC and Mir=ant Canada, as well as those coming over from TransCanada Gas Services, a d=ivision of TransCanada Energy Ltd. However, in the interim, the TransCanada=trades would still be covered by the existing master. TransCanada Pipeline=s will terminate their guaranty of this entity with respect to these transa=ctions.  Alternatively, Mirant Corp has agreed to amend their existing guar=anty covering physical gas transactions between Mirant Canada Energy Market=ing Ltd. and Enron Canada Corp by increasing the coverage from USD $30 mill=ion to USD $50 million. This entity also has some exposure with Enron North=America, which will also be covered under the existing Mirant Corp. guaran=ty for USD $10 million.A contract between ENA and Mirant Canada Energy Marketing Ltd. would also b=e an ideal outcome out of this; however, the first priority is getting a ne=w physical gas master between ECC and Mirant Canada Energy Marketing Ltd.If there is any other information that I can provide on this matter, please=do not hesitate to contact me.ThanksRandy OttoSenior Credit AnalystEnron Canada Corp.3500 Canterra Tower400 - 3rd Avenue S.W.Calgary, AlbertaT2P 4H2403-974-6716 (ph)403-974-6706 (fax)"

You will also notice that the detail following the majority of theadjustments is Unaccounted For Gas.  At the close of business for the 991P&L, we saw a gain of approx. $250,000 because of a blowout in UA4.  Wethought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it tooffset the PMA's we would take as a result of this UA4 blowout.  Therefore,the net impact of 9911 PMA's is $41,119 or 2% of last day P&L.I just wanted to congratulate the team on a great P&L for the month ofNovember.-Eric"

    "Any idea what amount of switching in gas equivalents does the implied demandof resid equate to?See note on switching. It is hard to monitor the distiallte because anyswitching is being absorbed by the incessant arrival of European cargoes. Wehope to have you guys some better numbers before the end of the week.---------------------- Forwarded by Jennifer Fraser/HOU/ECT on 20/12/2000Alex Mcleish@ENRONPIRA report attached - bit uninspired this week, like the stats.Crude went back to the usual pattern and built 2 .4 mbbls, as opposed to animplied draw (excl SPR) of 2 (although half of this in PADD 5). Perhapssurprisingly, runs were down again, but most of this was non-CDU, andgasoline bore the brunt of the output drop as a result.Distillate demand, the main factor to watch, did fall, but not by much (240kbd), and only another weak import showing prevented a build. The coldweather and switching are definitely having an impact, as this demand is wellabove last year's Y2K inflated levels. Most of the draw was in low sulphurmaterial, but PADD 1 still suffered a 500 kbbls drop in heating oil stocks.However, it does sems to be building up in PADD 3.Gasoline stocks did build, but interestingly only in blending components, notthe finished material. Evidence of high gas prices impacting on production?Stocks rose in PADD 1 by almost the same amount as they fell in PADD 3.Imports were very strong, however, at 500 kbd.Again, the real shoker was resid - demand up 57% to 1600 kbd, an incrediblyhigh number, and clear evidence (if repeated next week) of switching."

The September 11th events resulted in c=ns related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments, i=nsurance claims, and waived finance charges and late fees. The combination =of these items totaled approximately $98 million pre-tax ($65 million after=-tax).   The company also incurred costs of approximately $42 million since=September 11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequentl=y, these costs did not impact the quarterly results. These include the cost=of duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of th=e company's offices in lower Manhattan and certain other business recovery =expenses. Costs associated with the damage to the company's offices, extra =operating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluat=ed. The company expects that a substantial portion ofgh its Ists and losses=will be covered by insurance.   The third quarter restructuring charge inc=ludes severance costs for the elimination of approximately 6,100 jobs and a=sset impairment and other costs, all relating to the consolidation and reor=ganization of certain business units, the scale back of corporate lending i=n certain regions, the migration of certain processes to lower cost locatio=ns, the outsourcing of certain activities, and the transition of certain pr=ocessing and service functions to the Internet. These initiatives are expec=ted to produce expense savings of approximately $325 million in 2002. A por=tion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form o=f improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinves=ted back into high-growth areas of the business.   In addition to the activ=ities related to the restructuring charge, the company made strong progress=on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the yea=r and, as of September 30, had realized savings in excess of $700 million. =Net income for the third quarter, adjusted for the restructuring and one-=time costs related to September 11th, was approximately $595 million, down =19 percent. On a similar basis, earnings per share were $.45, down 17 perce=nt. The company's adjusted return on equity was 16.7 percent.   \"While we w=ere on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings, the terro=rist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and =we saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending, business travel and inv=estment activity slowed after September 11th,\" said Kenneth I. Chenault, ch=airman and chief executive officer, American Express Company. \"In light of =the weak economy and financial markets, we are moving aggressively to lower=our operating expenses. The progress we are making on our reengineering in=itiatives has freed up substantial resources for investment in our business=es with the strongest growth potential. This, along with the anticipated be=nefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franc=hise, positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in=the economy.\"   Travel Related Services (TRS) reported quarterly net incom=e of $248 million, down 51 percent from $507 million in the third quarter a=year ago. Included in third quarter results are $195 million pre-tax ($127=million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Also include=d in the results are $87 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of one-tim=e costs and waived fees directly related to the September 11th terrorist at=tacks. Excluding these costs and the restructuring charge, TRS' net income =would have been $432 million, down 15 percent from the third quarter last y=ear.   TRS' net revenues rose two percent, as growth in loans and fee reven=ues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a =28 percent fall in travel sales. These declines reflect a substantial decre=ase in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel sinc=e September 11th. Prior to September, billed business growth for the quarte=r was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offs=et a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending. Net finance ch=arge revenues were higher, due to balance growth and wider net interest yie=lds. This increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introd=uctory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter=.   The provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of =higher volumes and an increase in U.S. lending write-off rates and delinque=ncies. Marketing and promotion expenses were lower as TRS scaled back certa=in marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment. Operating=expenses rose, reflecting increased Cardmember loyalty programs and busine=ss volumes. These expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineer=ing and cost-control efforts.   The above discussion presents TRS results \"=on a managed basis\" as if there had been no securitization transactions, wh=ich conforms to industry practice. The attached financials present TRS resu=lts on both a managed and reported basis. Net income is the same in both fo=rmats.   On a reported basis, TRS' results included securitization gains of=$29 million pre-tax ($19 million after-tax) and $26 million pre-tax ($17 m=illion after-tax) in the third quarters of 2001 and 2000, respectively. The=se gains were offset by expenses related to card acquisition activities and=therefore had no material impact on net income or total expenses.   Americ=an Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) reported quarterly net income of $145 =million, down 46 percent from $269 million in the third quarter a year ago.=Net revenues decreased 14 percent. Included in third quarter results are $=62 million pre-tax ($41 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge note=d earlier and $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) of insurance claim=s directly related to September 11th. Excluding these items, AEFA's net inc=ome would have been $194 million, down 28 percent from last year.   AEFA re=sults reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on =the investment portfolio. The weakened equity markets led to significantly =lower asset levels and lower sales of investment products. As a result, man=agement and distribution fees fell 15 percent.   Operating expenses, exclud=ing the above-mentioned charges, decreased four percent from a year ago due=primarily to lower sales commissions and continued reengineering and cost-=control initiatives.   As of September 30th, approximately 4 percent of the=company's $33 billion investment portfolio consisted of high-yield securit=ies, down from 12 percent a year ago and 8 percent last quarter. The reduct=ion reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfo=lio and concentrate on stronger credits.   American Express Bank (AEB) repo=rted a quarterly net loss of $43 million, compared with $7 million of net i=ncome a year ago. Included in third quarter results are $84 million pre-tax=($57 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Excludi=ng these charges, AEB's net income would have been $15 million, approximate=ly double the earnings recorded in the same period last year.   While AEB s=ustained damage to its premises due to the September 11th terrorist attacks=, the costs are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these co=sts did not impact AEB's quarterly results.   AEB's business results reflec=t strong performance in Personal Financial Services and Private Banking. Re=sults also benefited from lower funding costs and lower operating expenses =as a result of AEB's reengineering efforts. These were offset in part by hi=gher provisions for losses due to higher Personal Financial Services loan b=alances, and lower revenue from Corporate Banking as the company continues =to shift its focus to Personal Financial Services and Private Banking.   Co=rporate and Other reported net expenses of $52 million, compared with $46 m=illion a year ago. Included in third quarter 2001 results are $11 million p=re-tax ($7 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier.   =2001 Third Quarter Earnings Supplement will be available today on the Ameri=estor conference call to discuss third quarter earnings results, operating =performance and other topics that may be raised during the discussion will =/ir.americanexpress.com .

We have three offerings currentlyavailable (or coming soon) that I feel would compliment the small/mid capand fixed income exposure you already have through Redwood, Sequoia, andWillow.to drive aggressive (and potentially leveraged) asset allocation decisions.Generates exposure to stock and bond markets through indexing techniques andfutures transactions.  Portfolio market exposures can range from +325% to-175% of net assets.  This is clearly different from the largelynon-leveraged stock-picker funds you already own.  I would consider this tobe a predominately large-cap investment (I think of it as an index fund witha brain and on steroids - call me and I'll explain that comment in moredetail).global biotech and pharma.  Up to 30% participation in private equity.  Thiscould be a way to get you some private equity exposure with a world-classmanager.the international mid-cap market.  I feel this fund is very similar in styleto the managers you already own, but would give you exposure to theinternational markets that you currently lack.  This is a new fund and thefirst closing will probably be in June.Of course, the summaries above are for information purposes only and do notconstitute an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy interests inthese funds.  Please call me if you're interested in any of the strategiesoutlined above, and I'll have the appropriate offering memorandum sent toyou.Thanks,> Michael Gapinski> Account Vice President> Emery Financial Group> PaineWebber, Inc.> 713-654-0365> 800-553-3119 x365>do not transmit orders and/or instructions regarding yourPaineWebber account(s) by e-mail.

They suggested we inform you of the problems, in the hopethat you would be able to take it to a higher level on our behalf.Up until a year ago American Express were based on the Wilton Site.  Theymigrated to Newcastle (about 50 miles away)  and  migrated again some sixmonths later to Edinburgh ( about 120 miles away).  Each time they have movedthe level of service we have received has deteriorated.Some six weeks ago we had a meeting with Lisa McKenzie (Area Manager) fromthe Edinburgh office, at which we detailed our concerns to her.  She saidthat she valued our business and promised to take these concerns away and torectify all problems.  In reality nothing improved, to the extent that we hadanother meeting with George Blues (Account manager)  last week, and informedhim that we had not seen any changes for the better.  We also told him thatif things did not improve within the next six weeks, we would consider takingour business elsewhere.  We have actually made contact with a local companyand are using them in conjunction with Amex for the next six weeks.Communications - trying to contact people in Edinburgh is difficult.Response when we do contact them is not forthcoming.  Not being able to speakto the same person twice.  Promises of return calls do not materialise.Invoices - difficulty in resolving disputes.Car Hire - not negotiating the best deal with regards to rates.  Wenegotiated better rates with Avis ourselves.Hotel Bookings - not using Enrons preferential rates on hotels with reservedrooms.Rail Travel - lack of detail on tickets.We feel that they are paying lip service to what we are saying and makinggeneral excuses in the non performance of their obligations.We hope you can assist us in getting a better level of service than thatwhich we are currently receiving.RegardsLesleyRespect====>Integrity====>Communication====>ExcellenceThe information contained in this e-mail and any files transmitted with it isconfidential and intended for the addressee only.

  "Answer": [
    "Pam,Can you help with below?David-----Original Message-----David,For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3.Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states \"Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?\".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of \"a single sum distribution\" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.Phillip-----Original Message-----For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a \"single sum distribution,\" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan."

    "Jennifer,I spoke w/Jenny Rub about almost every BMC/EBS issue, except for this one.  Idid not know about the issue which Bruce Smith has sent (blue text, below) toJenny and Bob McAuliffe.  When I spoke w/Jenny, I was unaware of BMC'sretraction.  It is new news to me, and at the very least, doesn't seem very\"customer-focused\" on BMC's part.  I certainly agree w/Bruce's statement tothe effect that BMC needs to meet w/Philippe about their pricing!JKYJenny RubBruce Smith/ENRON@enronXgateBMC rep left message recanting the fact that we would still have the 45 %discount if SAP modules were purchased at some other time.  He states nowthat if not purchased now the discount would only be 10-20 % range at a laterdate.Bruce-----Original Message-----Jenny/BobTidalSoft, SysadmiralApprox.  90 k  ( current quote covers us and GPG and does not include SAP )We have added a couple of pieces to this and it could bring the cost to 125 kworst case.  This quote covers consulting and maintenance.  They are tryingvery hard to get a deal done this year  and we could probably get ouradditional components at the current quote price if we signed.BMC, Control -MApprox. 325 k   This is after we remove the SAP modules and components fromthe quote. Quote that was sent over from Jeff Youngflesh (Enron GSS) was fora total of 628 kHardware for either product is approx. 300 k.We have conferred with the SAP team and they are not desperate for us to takeover their scheduling but think it is a good idea to include them in our longterm strategy. They actually do not recommend either of these product's SAPmodules and mentioned a third party product (Autosys) that has connectorsinto BMC.  We are not sure at this point about a connector into TidalSoft(Larry if you have info on this please comment).Larry's and his team have eval'd both products and although they are leaningtowards Sysadmiral they are satisfied that both products are acceptable.  Youguys make the call as to whether the additional 200 k is worth the weight itwill lend to the EBS/BMC deal.  FYI - BMC rep said that we still get 45%discount if we cut the SAP modules.  BMC needs to sit down with PB and learnhow over priced their products are !Let me know what you think.  If we go TidalSoft I need to push this throughor be advised to let it go till the New Year.ThanksBruce*****BMC, Control SA1.3 M     NOT EVALUATED AT THIS TIME  - Is a candidate for futureconsideration for the Security Admin space but not enough info to speculateas to whether to try and leverage current deal with EBS.

This is unacceptable.-----Original Message-----Fred-There are a number of issues we need to address with back office procedures immediately.  We are losing money on avoidable problems and gaining a bad reputation in the market.  Lets get Derek and Michelle together Tuesday afternoon.2 of our counterparties are writing letters of complaint.. here's a sample of some of the quotes we have heard from the 10 counterparties we have added in the last 6 months.\"I shouldn't have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmations you send out\"\"It has been 10 days since we traded and we haven't received a shred of paper to give us the details of the trade\"\"We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoiced for\"\"We did not trade 300 contracts per day, it was per month - do you guys even think before you type\"\"I am a CFO and an accountant and I can't decipher what you are trying to confirm here\"From a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers. One, upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said \"they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare.. they couldn't rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm.  This was a captive client who and needs to trade... who will not show us their flow again.\"we just want to do a small trade to test your system. We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves - I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude\" And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details, not one phone call to confirm the trade...nothing.  We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently. Well, clearly we failedWe do not understand what is going on in the back office.  Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business?  Is there too much turnover? How are they trained?  Who is in charge of the \"backoffice\"?  There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process.. who co-ordinates all their efforts?  Does anyone care?  Ok.. I'll stop.. For our part, we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December (we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her).We have to stop this before we lose clients (which we will).1. Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients.  This has already cost us money this year. Our clients do 10 trades a day.. they are constantly in and out of positions.. it is imperative that we get these right.  As well, this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system.There are hundreds of books at Enron.  We have postions on with dozens of them.  We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot.  We have to select books one by one.. this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow.Michelle is in charge of this process.  We need a IT person on this yesterday.  Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates.  Robyn, Russell, and I check it everyday.. there are always mistakes.2. There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them.  There is no check after they have been imput.  There are ALWAYS imput errors.  Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward.We also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals.  We have no idea where our job ends and the book admin's starts.. for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish.2a. Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered.. what if deals are imput incorrectly? the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client.  Going forward, confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct.2b. Invoicing.. there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done..3. EOL- We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here.. we have signed Renaissance up (a 10B program fund) but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks.4. Credit- All of our clients are margined.  If deals are in the system incorrectly, the wrong MTM goes to the client.. another mis-match.  We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients.. this amount changes daily- we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through.. again, we are doing this now."

    "As mentioned earlier, we have the opportunity to sell a 76MW, 7x24, fixed for floating financial swap to these guys for 5 years beginning 1/1/02.  They want offers from both the PJM-East and PJM-West Hubs.  In an effort to lower the fixed price, they are willing to sell let us curtail during Monday-Friday for the term of the deal on an hour-ahead basis.  There can be a variety of call option structures, depending upon which gives them the largest premium (options being number of hours which we can curtail each day).  Nick has begun working on valuing an at the money, 5x8 call (effectively an 8-hour curtailment), with hour-ahead notice.  Rob Benson is pricing the swap.  As soon as we get the swap price (and the resulting strike price for the call), Nick can firm up his initial valuation and we can discuss with you.Billy BraddockManager - Enron Power Marketing Inc.713-345-7877 (work)713-646-4940 (fax)713-503-2166 (cell)"

    "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/15/2001Please respond to aod@newsdata.comFYI Western Price Survey ContactsCal-ISO's declaration of Stage Two alert this morning was triggeredin part by decision of Bonneville Power Administration to ceasehour-to-hour sales into California of between 600 MW and 1,000MW that it had been making for the past week. According to BPA,it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meetbiological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so inorder to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it hadbeen telling California's Department of Water Resources that thesales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today thanyesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California becauseof concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sendingexchange energy into California, however.More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of theWestern Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter."

It'spretty evident in hindsight that we should have listened to Ollie!In a recent university lecture the other day they played a video ofOliver North during the Iran-Contra deals during the Reaganadministration.There was Ollie in front of God and Country getting the third degree. Butwhat he said was stunning. He was being grilled by some senator who askedhim; 'Did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home securitysystem?'Oliver replied, 'Yes I did sir.'The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the audience, 'Isn'tthis just a little excessive?''No sir,' continued Oliver.'No. And why not?''Because the life of my family and I were threatened.''Threatened? By who.''By a terrorist, sir.''Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?''His name is Osama bin Laden.'At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn'tpronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple ofpeople laughed at the attempt and then the senator continued.'Why are you so afraid of this man?''Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know of.''And what do you recommend we do about him?''If it were me I would recommend an assassin team be formed to eliminatehim and his men from the face of the earth.' The senator disagreed withthis approach and that was the end of the video clip.It's scary when you think 15 years ago the government was aware of Osamabin Laden and his potential threat to the security of the world. I guesslike all great tyrants they start small but if left untended spread likethe virus they truly are.\""

We should not rely on the PX to tell us what the level is. Weshould confirm it ourselves.

Thisdumbfoundingly simple sounding rule is important.  Somehow, when wecommunicate our decision to the PX to go from physical to financial, weshould give our reason.

    "kevinfinnan@compuserve.comjennifer.medcalf@enron.comjennifer.medcalf@enron.comEnronAnthony GilmoreJeff YoungfleshBristol BabcockKevin FinnanJim GriffethPagosa Energy/Well MasterRob Bender1)  Bristol and Well Master feel that there is significant opportunity, withplacement of enough BBI TeleFlow devices (integrated flow computer,corrector, recorder and controller/RTU) in North America that the datatransmission needs would generate enough bandwidth demand that it would be ofinterest to EBS to provide some of its solutions to Bristol & Pagosa Energythis could take a longer term to reach the necessary \"critical status\", dueto the need for a very large hardware install base since each TeleFlowgenerates only about 11 - 12,000 bytes of data per day in its report bursts.1a)  In this scenario, the EBS opportunity would be primarily driven by salesof product solutions by BBI and Pagosa, which would include EBS networkcapacity.  (a \"sell-through\" effect for EBS)2)  There could also be enough demand for bandwidth- or related EBS solutionsto Bristol by including Bristol's own internal I/T bandwidth consumption thataccelerate to the necessary \"critical status\", bringing to EBS more solutionsdemand due to the addition of \"sell-to\".  The \"sell-through\" effect would bepresent with Bristol/Pagosa selling solutions which use EBS' solutions (asales \"channel\"), as well as EBS \"sell-to\" BBI & Pagosa for their owninternal consumption of bandwidth.____________________________________________________________________1)  Bristol will provide Anthony (Tony) Gilmore of Enron Broadband Servicesthe necessary contact information for the appropriate people in FKI's(Bristol's parent co.) Info/Technology area.2) Enron GSS contacts (J Youngflesh) will attempt to ascertain if there wouldbe value to Enron (GPG?) and/or its customers if they had the ability toexecute nomination control all the way to the ground (upstream of gaswell-head).3) EBS (Tony Gilmore) will begin working on the I/T discovery process,at Bristol and/or Pagosa.3a)  Per Rob Bender, Tony Gilmore should be contacting Al Freimeyer (sp?) atPagosa to understand the volum of data from their daily batches fromwell-to-vendor.  Rob provided Tony Al's telephone number on 12/1.4)  Enron GSS to contact Ron Smith - waterSCADA.com - to investigate parallelopportunity (gas / water analog).5)  EBS and BBI/Pagosa will begin (internal efforts) to figure out ways ofgetting the TeleFlow CDPD data onto the EBS \"Enron Intelligent Network\"Please let me know if I've missed anything.Thank you,JeffJeff YoungfleshDirector, Business DevelopmentGlobal Strategic SourcingEnron Corp.333 Clay Street, 11th FloorHouston, TX 77002Bender Rob <rebende@earthlink.net>It was a pleasure meeting with you last Friday with Jim Griffith andKevin Finnan of Bristol Babcock.  Perhaps by now you have had anlook at aspects of the \"demo\" section.  This is a very dynamic programwith changes, upgrades, and customization taking place all the time tomeet the individual needs of our customers.There may well be a good fit here as we are seeking ever faster means ofcommunication and will be requiring a substantial infrastructure notonly for communications but for data base hosting as well.  While yet inits infancy we have received very positive feedback and interest fromnumerous oil and gas companies in the industry.  An alliance with Enronto help us on the road to becoming the \"Microsoft\" of oil and gas wellautomation would be a very alluring prospect.  I would like to keep adialog going between us to scope out areas of mutual benefit for our twocompanies where such an alliance would make sense.I hope to hear from you soon.Sincerely,Rob Bender,President - PagosaEnergy.comrob@pagosaenergy.com"

Seasonal quotes (winter '03, summer '04, etc.)In short, try to obtain pricing to match any positions which we currently have in the books.  I know that this will be difficult to accomplish, but please do what you can.  We need these quotes for every day starting with Nov 28 through today.  We will continue to need daily updates for the immediate future.Also, I am aware that our current position doesn't give us much stroke to ask for a lot of pricing data.  However, this information is critical as it will be needed for calculation of termination values.  Please do whatever you can to obtain as much data as possible.  Additionally, we need to get quotes from as many different brokers as possible to help verify pricing.Please let me know if the brokers are not accomodating your requests; we may need to ask John or Louise to place calls into the brokers to move this process along.If you have any questions or comments, you can normally find me in the \"war room\" next to Louise's office.

  "Budget Language on Cal PX": [
    "david.forster@enron.com, john.neslage@enron.com,james.steffes@enron.comIt looks as though the budget language which would unwind the Commission'srecent decision to allow competition with the Cal PX will be passed.Therefore, in the near term, the Cal PX is the only trading vehicle for theutilities.Our lobbyists found NO support in the legislature to buck the language.Principally because the president of the Commission, Loretta Lynch, was theone seeking a legislative fix to unwind a decision that her agency issued.She had greased the skids with both the Republicans and the Democrats tosupport the language.So, as a result, the only thing that the Commission can do at this point isstudy the affects of introducing competition with the Cal PX and issue areport to the legislature by June 1, 2001.  Prior to that date, theCommission cannot implement any decision on this issue.  Effectively, by thetime any change would occur, we could be at/or near the end of the transitionperiod, when the mandatory buy/sell requirement would terminate.We can encourage the Commission to study this issue and use the time as anopportunity to educate the Commission(ers) about Enron OnLine.  If there wereperceptions that we would not qualify as an exchange, this would be a goodtime to dispel that bias.  Government Affairs would be happy to work with youin organizing such an event."

PaineWebber knows affluentinvestors such as yourself want access to alternative investments such asprivate equity and hedge funds.  Our group has also found that high networth individuals prefer a consultative relationship where we help youstructure a complete asset allocation based on your objectives.  We thenprovide you with access to, and help you select, third-party institutionalmoney managers to make the day-to-day investment decisions.  We also providethe ongoing performance monitoring of those managers, including correlationsto the appropriate indices.I believe you will find our approach to be appreciably different from yourprevious contacts with financial advisors, where you have felt the advisorwas 'pushing' a house fund or stock du jour.

The document doesnot fully address all of the issues discussed at last Thursday's congestionreform meeting in Sacramento, but I believe that (other than for somedetails) it is consistent with what both the ISO and many of the marketparticipants are proposing.This summary does not necessarily reflect the views of my clients, whohaven't yet had the time to review it... but I don't believe that it would betoo far off.I am sending this summary to you to put into context the many comments that Ioffered at last Thursday's meeting and also to support my view that, if theISO were to implement the CONG/ASM integration by DECENTRALIZING the processrather than CENTRALIZING the process, there would not be much differencebetween what I've been advocating in the Southwest and the CAISO's model.process works - i.e., continuously vs. one discrete time; and (ii) the wayscheduling is done - i.e., the ISO would not act as the SC's representativein acquiring rights that could be made available through inter-zonalcounterflows since the SCs would do this themselves.)  So there is a realpossibility that, with some agreement on the ISO's longer-term plans (whetherintegration of transmission rights and ancillary services procurement willrely on decentralization vs. centralization), we could bring together themodels for the region.Carlany feedback... but if you want me to see it, be sure to send it tocfi1@tca-us.com, NOT the enron address from which this e-mail was sent.Carl]"

The Market Participantshave been very cooperative in working with the ISO.  The mutual objectiveswere to assure accurate settlement of Imbalance Energy, to rectify start-upmeter data management problems and to minimize UFE.The overall magnitude of erroneous UFE identified by the ISO UFE Project isapproximately 1,100,000 MWhs or $ 70,000,000.  The ISO Settlements andMetering Department staffs are in the process of recalculating the specificmarket charges impacted, for this period.Actual retro-active UFE adjustments will commence on July 3, 2000, and beapplied initially to the May 9th Preliminary Settlement Statement (PSS). TheISO's intention is to correct 15 settlement days per week over the next 10weeks until the entire 1999 August 21-December 31 period settlements arecorrected.  The ISO Settlements system time required to rerun settlementsconstrains our ability to proceed more expeditiously.  However, we do plancompletion by the end of Summer.The ISO will apply retroactive adjustments to ALL UFE related Marketcharges. The erroneous UFE identified by the ISO UFE Project will be chargedto the responsible Scheduling Coordinators (SCs), to help assure that noadverse market impact occurs from cost shifting.  Other SCs will receive theassociated charge type credits.FINAL REPORT TO MARKET PARTICIPANTS - Fall 1999 ISO UFE PROJECTOn August 21, 1999, UFE in the PG&E Service Area increased substantially,ranging from 4-15 %.   This inordinately high UFE continued in excess oftypical amounts of UFE for this UDC Service Area (-1 to +1%), for fourmonths.The ISO actively investigated potential systemic causes for this order ofmagnitude increase in UFE.ISO efforts consisted of a concerted review of SQMD submitted by SC's duringthis period, a review of the ISO MDAS polled meter data for ISO meteredentities, a review of interchange data (exports), a review of theTransmission Loss calculations used by ISO Settlements to calculate UFE byUDC, an investigation of the Market Redesign Settlements software changesassociated with the drop of new Settlements software in mid- August and theretention of a data consultant to help identify and isolate any causalfactor, attributable for the high UFE .The effort to identify UFE related settlement issues for the period ofAugust 21, 1999 through December 31, 1999 is complete.  The ISO UFE Projectteam, working in conjunction with Market Participants, identified over 1.1million MWH of erroneous UFE. This UFE is now accounted for, and will bereassigned to the responsible SCs. The ISO Project identified over 14 casualsources of UFE during this period.  Many of the issues identified wereinterrelated.The last major source of UFE for the period was identified in April. ThisUFE resulted from an erroneous Validation, Editing and Estimating (VEE)factor, applied to firm load within the PG&E Service Area.  This error,associated with late or missed meter data adjustment, commenced October 1,1999 and resulted in understated SC load of approximately 100 - 267 MW/hour,through December.The balance of the SC meter data management errors previously identifiedwere attributable to the complexity of using Pseudo Resources and LogicalMetering to model, schedule and settle Municipal UDC existing contracts(ETCs).The four primary SCs which experienced meter data problems, within the PG&EUDC Service Area, have resubmitted corrected Settlement Quality Meter Data(SQMD).The ISO will initiate retroactive UFE Market adjustments for the Settlementperiod of August 21,1999 through December 31, 1999.  The magnitude of theMarket UFE adjustment is approximately $70 million. These retro-activeMarket adjustments will complete the Project Team's work on the Fall 1999UFE issue.System UFE         +0.22 %PG&E UDC Service Area UFE   + 0.17 %SCE UDC Service Area UFE    + 0.44 %SDG&E UDC Service Area UFE   -  0.45%ISO UFE Project TeamSarah Ten BroeckKevin GravesBill HayesKyle HoffmanTri HuynhGlen PerezJeanette PlumleyChris SibleyJune 15, 2000CRCommunicationsClient Relations Communications"

  "CAISO Notice - Congestion Management Reform Proposal Posting": [
    "The CAISO has posted its draft Congestion Management Reform(CMR) recommendation on its web site atrecommends changes to the CAISO's current Congestion Management process andrelated features of its business practices and operations. This is a draftdocument, albeit one that we believe reflects significant effort and thoughton the part of both the stakeholders who provided the initial input and theinterdisciplinary design team that drafted this document.This CMR recommendation represents an essential milestone inthe broader Congestion Management Reform Project.  The first stage involvedsoliciting stakeholder input regarding the problems to be solved,alternative solutions to address these problems, and criteria for evaluatingreform proposals. The second stage involved the CAISO's crafting anintegrated, internally consistent reform package utilizing the ideasdeveloped with and/or by Stakeholders in stage one. This document containsthe CAISO's draft recommendation. We emphasize that, although we believethis recommendation package to be a necessary milestone in the CongestionManagement Reform Project, it is not intended to predispose the finaldesign. We are actively soliciting Stakeholders' comments and critiquesconcerning this recommendation over the coming weeks (stage three of the CMRproject).Once the next round of stakeholder input has been assessed,the CAISO will revise this CMR recommendation. The revised recommendationwill be presented to the CAISO Governing Board for discussion and reviewonly on August 1 (no Board action requested). The CMR recommendation willcontinue to be developed through August and the final recommendation will besubmitted to the CAISO Governing Board for approval at the September 6th and7th meeting.  The approved CMR recommendation will be prepared (inconjunction with Stakeholders) for the final Tariff filing to FERC inNovember (stage four). A revised, detailed calendar will be presented at theCMR Stakeholder meetings on July 13 and 14.At the July 13 and 14 Stakeholder meetings, the CAISO willpresent the entire recommendation, section-by-section and provide theopportunity for Stakeholders to clarify their understanding of what is beingproposed. Shortly thereafter, we will hold additional Stakeholder meetingsto facilitate detailed discussion of individual elements of therecommendation. Additional meeting dates will be discussed on July 14 at themeeting.We look forward to reviewing this proposal with you andreceiving your comments. The CAISO welcomes any and all comments andcritiques of this recommendation. We appreciate your attention and effortsin this endeavor to reform the Congestion Management process.Byron WoertzDirector, Client Relations"

  "CAISO demand reduction": [
    "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 04/10/2001Enron North America Corp.Motley/PDX/ECT@ECT, Michael M Driscoll/PDX/ECT@ECT, ChrisMallory/PDX/ECT@ECT, Jeff Richter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECT,Sean Crandall/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mark Fischer/PDX/ECT@ECT, Bill WilliamsIII/PDX/ECT@ECT, Diana Scholtes/HOU/ECT@ECTPhillip et al.,the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs.March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demandover the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting fortemperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translatesinto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) ascompared with the previous year.Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntaryreductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Otherforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (makingtotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couplemore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6%decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to theretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that itis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to lastyear.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa inJun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservationare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood ofmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the generaleconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at leastmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control areaonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISOportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions indemand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  Asyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminumsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off atleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets itswish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Severalmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they aresharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactlyhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif'seconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest ofthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, Ithink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% alreadyrealized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in thenon-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for theWSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide youwith updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, Ihope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have anyquestions or need any further information."

We invite yo=mmissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy =players just like yourself!   =09Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA     Which two receivers should I=start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Te=rry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce =Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?    Answe=r - GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start agai=nst a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards a=nd three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously=not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have t=o go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so =going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To a=nswer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carol=ina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but=Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at=best, so our hands are tied.  =09Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye th=is week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weink=e. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsist=ent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be =facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players=like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a b=ig game.  =09non Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin J=ohnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still av=ailable.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target i=n the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sha=rpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we hi=ghly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his =current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not =good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers=will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after an=other No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fa=ntasy player.  =09giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive optio=n the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk a=fter five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes=will continue to be a productive player all season.   =09This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

  "CSFB Columbia/Appalachia Hedging Deal": [
    "Certainly encourage CSFP to transact all volumes with us.  If they shop thedeal, everyone will front-run the volumes and they won't get a good price onthe deal.Financial deals settle 5 days after the index has been published.  Physicaldeals settle much later.   My understanding is this is a financial deal.Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, William SBradford/HOU/ECT@ECTThe New York office has been speaking to Credit Suisse First Boston forroughly 6 months about a producer hedging deal that is part of a strucutureddeal they're putting together. It now looks as if it will get done in thenext 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues takencare of.In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) andCNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle againstthe Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is fromDecember, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term fromroughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of theproducers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message withmore details.There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants toclarify.First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would likepayment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date boththe floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it,  for theDecember settlement, which would be known in early December, cash paymentwould take place on February 15, 2000.Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp.Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA andCredit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that wewould be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from EnronCorp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million.(CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they'vedone with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue).There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions withthe aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings withEnronCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston.However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to thistransaction.CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to splitit among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meetingwith Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one.Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the endof this week.Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.Regards,Russ"

The meeting is a broadstakeholder meeting to help refine our load participation programs for 2001.Much of the day will be committed to presentations and discussions onlessons learned from 2000 and proposals for 2001, including technicalstandards, contractual issues, and load management.Some vendors have approached the ISO with systems that wouldaggregate loads, give them an opportunity to curtail based on day aheadenergy prices, and provide the curtailment instructions and verifications.This type of program may be ultimately sold to ESPs or IOUs. In order toaccelerate the testing of such systems the ISO may sponsor a pilot programto test the system/approach with selected vendors.  The pilot program willtest the concepts, the interfaces, and assist in bringing together vendors,ESPs, SCs, and the IOUs as we move forward toward improving demandresponsiveness in our markets.  We have reserved about 1 -2 hours in theafternoon, to allow 3-4 vendors to present their approaches to thestakeholder group.In addition, we welcome you to visit a vendor fair that theISO is hosting on September 21, 2000.  The ISO has  experiencedconsiderable interest from the market place in such a vendor fair that wouldinclude entities providing Data Processing Gateway technology for bothGenerators and Loads in the Participating Ancillary Services Load Program.This effort is being encouraged to develop multiple solutions pertaining toinstallations of direct telemetry for Generators and Load providingAncillary Services to the ISO markets.The agendas are attached for both events, includingdirections and lodging information.Please RSVP by September 13, 2000 to Sue Happ atshapp@caiso.com.Thank you.<<AGENDA 9_20_00_timelines3_.doc>>  <<AGENDA 9_21_00_timelines3_.doc>><<Lodging and Directions.pdf>>Keoni AlmeidaCalifornia Independent System Operator- AGENDA 9_20_00_timelines3_.doc- AGENDA 9_21_00_timelines3_.doc- Lodging and Directions.pdf"

There were several issues and concernswhich were voiced, mostly related to BMC's lack of support and suboptimalapplication capability (that is the \"net\", understated version).Bob, you and I spoke briefly after the meeting regarding what, if anything,BMC could do to \"fix their problem\".  I relayed the gist of our briefconversation to EBS.As discussed in the meeting, EBS has a near-term opportunity to get a dealdone with BMC, and it would be of optimum benefit to execute this year.  Oneof the outcomes of our November 17 meeting is that EBS has been pressing BMCfor a BMC commitment to Enron's overall customer satisfaction.  Per avoicemail to me from EBS, it appears that BMC have provided a response to EBS.I would like to schedule a meeting for the addressees of this note for eitherNovember 30th, or December 1st.  The purpose is to get an update from theNetWorks team on the BMC application testing that was underway, and for EBSto explain what BMC has proposed.

    "Kristin,Have you seen any studies associated with the opinions that the $12B is not enough.  I would like to see some calculations that multiply the net short by the power cost and compare that to the amounts collected through rates.Phillip-----Original Message-----PLEASE TREAT AS CONFIDENTIALA source had a meeting today with California state treasurer Phil Angelides.  Here are the main points from their conversation1.\tAnglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go BankruptCorroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that \"he was surprised they hadn't already.\"  He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that \"they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent\" and that \"their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it.\"He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the \"Plan B's\" are \"speculative\" at best.  He also thought that SoCal was being \"naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court.\"2.\tBond Issuance- $12B Not EnoughAngelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B.   The only reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that \"$12B was all the market could handle.\"  The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office.3.\tNew Generator ConstructionAnglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authorized by the legislature last week) will \"build plants and not stop until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand.  Angelides expects the state to be \"5-10% short on power all summer.\""

Any possibility for adeal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicansand Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus isreportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans andDemocrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once thebonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" intothe fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature andthe governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details ofthe power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-termpower contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that thebond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach ofcontract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridgeloan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be verydifficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the statewould \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the GeneralFund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even thisconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for fulldisclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including thedetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before theywill support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This billpassed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack ofRepublican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs forcommunity college districts.  However, sources report this bill may beamended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state shouldget paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would belikely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to moneyavailable in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has statedthat only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  TheRepublicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally,Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary andthere are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.Key Points of the Bridge FinancingLehman Brothers  $1.0 BBear Stearns  $625 MTax-Exempt Rate  4.77%Current ProjectedFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create theCalifornia Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billionauthorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must beauthorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or theadditional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasingpower going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of theseauthorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts thegovernor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bondamount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay tosupport.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paidfor purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. forthe California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this canbe considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting thisidea  earlier in the crisis.SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  Thefirst would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and thegovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU isAugust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  Accordingto sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal hassigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davisand the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicatesthat it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntarybankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bondissuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, thestate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included andpassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file forbankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities andthe DWR proportionately from rate payments."

  "Call to Discuss Possible Options to Mitigate Effect of DWR Contracts--Privileged and Confidential": [
    "Contracts--Privileged and Confidentialjeff,Is the problem that the energy DWR purchased is above market and not needed by CORE  or  just above market.  If the energy is needed by CORE wouldn't the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply?  If the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time.  Once again there would be a CTC type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered.Phillip-----Original Message-----PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis.In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron.The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).In effect, \"core\" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market.The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious).Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts.The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address \"the DWR contract problem\" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access.Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any \"out clauses\" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that \"outs\" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.)In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts.All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights.We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.Thanks,Jeff"

He visited me in Houston with a large team of people on the subject.  I called Credit Agricole (owner of Carr) in Houston and sadly it is feared that he did not make it out from the World Trade Center."

Clavijo had a stellar career as a player for both club and country, earning 61 caps with the United States. A part of the World Cup roster in 1994, he started and played the full 90 minutes in the USA's historic 2-1 win against Colombia.

In Saturday's match, the Galaxy will play in their third championship game of the year having previously claimed the CONCACAF Championship in January before losing 2-1 in overtime to the San Jose Earthquakes in the 2001 MLS Cup. Los Angeles is the first U.S. team to play in a Regional Championship, a Division I Championship and the U.S. Open Cup Final in the same calendar year.

Currently, Anne is in NY @ an ISDA conference and will return to the office on Thursday, November 29th.  However, yesterday Laurie Orchard @ CRRC called inquiring as to the status of our review to their latest round of comments (some which were Credit in nature).  Laurie asked that I touch base with you to get your thoughts, so that when Anne returns on Thursday -- we will be closer to a final document form.Please be advised, there was one other change CRRC requested, which related to Paragraph 13(b)(iv)(B) -- the determination of the exposure in weather-related deals.  As you know, Anne has furnished such language to Mark Tawney for his comments.  I do not believe that Mark has responded.  However, CRRC is willing to address this later under an amendment to the master.  Therefore, as you can see they are rather eager to sign a master with ENA and they are willing to address some of their issues at a later date.Let me know your thoughts.Regards,Susan S.

The campaign in general was very differentthan previous.   But I guess you know that and that's the point.   Again, Ithink the commercials that showed why we are the most innovative were veryimpressive.  Just telling people we are innovative made less of an impact.Sorry I ruined your run.  At least you weren't molested by the River Oaks carthief.So, what did you think?!  Don't lie or stretch the truth either -- you won'thurt my feelings, I promise.By the way, by the time I arrived home it was completely dark so I went for athree mile run this morning.  Not fun, but I'm definitely awake right now!BUT, it's all your fault I couldn't go last night....he!he!Trade well, MSA"

    "derrick.deakins@compaq.com, gil.melman@enron.comderrick.deakins@compaq.com, gil.melman@enron.comDavid and Bob,We look forward to working with you to strengthen the Compaq and EBSrelationship.   EBS has identified potential server business opportunities(storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together.After our meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlinas the point person for these communications.  EBS had prior direction fromCompaq to direct our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, KeithMcAuliffe or Kent Major.  Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spendingadditional time with David to ensure that he is aware of the EBS businessopportunities and issues.EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to developthe streaming media server solutions.  We discussed during the Dec 14thmeeting that there are decisions to be made regarding the existing Productand Server Supply Agreement that are contingent on those streaming mediasolutions.  EBS and Compaq have both acted in good faith to achieve theintent of the Product and Server Supply Agreement in pursuing thesesolutions.  To that end, EBS has had internal discussions regarding theappropriate next steps to further our relationship.The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal frameworkfor our relationship until both parties mutually agree to change.  Untilwas invoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November7, 2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.  Compaq had agreed  to the invoiceamount.  EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section 3.0on or before December 31,2000.Compaq (Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself).The understanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a writtennotice and payment by Compaq of $2,500,000.  The concept to start over with anew contractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting.EBS strongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, ifCompaq believes that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then welook forward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal.Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and createstrategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.Kim GodfreyDirector, Enterprise ServicesEnron Broadband Services"

Masses believe US got what it deserves, but leaders have to condemn attacks to maintain relations with Washington.  Moderate Arab leaders are concerned that support for attacks at home -- and possible US reactions to strike -- will increase instability and could lead to major upheaval in their countries.  Saudi sources expect \"state of confusion\" to exist for immediate period ahead.In the West, no intelligence or law enforcement agency has anything concrete yet. Everything is therefore speculation, albeit logical speculation. Most importantly, the sophistication means someone bigger than bin Laden was involved, even if he was the final perpetrator.Oil PoliticsOPEC's Rodriguez has reassured oil markets on supplies, but no high-level Saudi officials have officially echoed this sentiment (nothing from Oil Minister Naimi).  Unofficially, we have reports that Saudi officials reporting that the terrorist incident \"relieves pressure on us to make anti-US moves\" in oil policy."

  "Computer Associates - Meeting Notes": [
    "fyiKimAli KhojaGilmore/Enron Communications@Enron CommunicationsStephen Down and I met with Computer Associates in Toronto yesterday. Hereare some of my thoughts on how it went.We met with Julia in the morning -- went to CA's Toronto office, where wemade presentation on EBS. Later Julia made a presentation on ComputerAssociates, their Sales manager talked about their \"security suit ofproducts\", we were given a demonstration of their UniCenter TNG software, andthen taken to lunch.  At lunch, we were joined by the President of WorldwideOnline Corporation (a Canadian startup).Computer Associates is a highly centralized organization run by its founders.The company is the third largest independent software manufacturing businessin the world. It offers more then 800 software products. Like other companiesin their space, their stock has taken a beating this year losing more thenJulia Ruslys, is part of their \"Strategic Alliances\" team -- their mandate isStrategic Business AlliancesDevelopment Partner ProgrameForce technology unitAnalyst relationsCA's APPROACHComputer Associates sees EBS as a potential \"development partner\". Theirinterest seems to be in a long-term alliance with EBS, where they can packagetheir software with a bundled network offering (from EBS) for their clients.They claim that their main product UniCenter TNG has a 30% market share of ITinfrastructure management market. It is a cutting software package that canmanage all LANs or remote networks for an Enterprise. With a stunning graphicAll networks within an EnterpriseEach computer connected to a node within the enterprise can be monitored andmanaged remotely (software installation etc.)Their is a plethora of add-ons to the basic UniCenter package including someadvanced \"Asset Management\" tools that can predict future utilization througha neural network architecture.She commented that with UniCenter TNG, our clients have \"full control andflexibility over their whole network\" EXCEPT  THEIR BANDWIDTH NEEDS.  EBS'sflexible and intelligent BOS, if integrated with UniCenter TNG, can providean enterprise complete control over their IT infrastructure with exceptionalflexibility. Similarly they have a keen interesting in developing andexpanding their storage solutions.They seem to be interested in expanding their market opportunity andincreasing revenues through increasing the number of \"CA certifications\" andjoint selling initiatives. In other words, they would like EBS's network tobe CA-certified by developing compatibility between UniCenter TNG and IPNetConnect. They currently have 1500 partners, including almost all top names inIT infrastructure space.EBS APPROACH CONVEYEDAlthough I think we have conveyed EBS's approach of \"looking at specificquick and clear opportunities\", CA does not seem like a lean-meanorganization. Furthermore, the people that we met with, did not seem to havean appreciation of the financial structuring and risk management capabilities-- instead seemed to be disconnected with the corporate financial goals oftheir organization. For example, when Steve Dowd talked about financial riskmanagement tools, their sales manager started talking about how they helpenterprises manage risk through their \"security software packages.\"WORLDWIDE ONLINE CORP.Worldwide Online Corp. is a startup (with less then $2M revenues) that claimsto have good connections with CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corp.)  They were incontact with Brad Sims' group out of Portland. That group, at some point lostinterest in Worldwide because Worldwide are looking for video streamingservices. Being a start-up with no credit, it is understandable why they wereabandoned by us. Steve made it clear that he knows nothing about the deal andhe may give Brad a call. I personally do not see anything for us in the nexttwo quarters or so even though the company has been promised many sportsbroadcast opportunities by CBC.It is interesting that Worldwide Online is a small client of CA. Julia wentout of her way to convince us to meet with Worldwide Online. At one point, Ialmost thought as if her main goal was to promote a dialogue between EBS andWorldwide online.Steve and I made it clear that it will be important for us to look at somespecific short to medium-term opportunity with CA. Julia is going to identifythe people in her organization whom we can have constructive dialogue withregards to IP connectivity needs of CA (their network infrastructureprocurement team.)  At the same time, we had to show an interest in bringingher team together with our product development people to see if anyintegration opportunities exist between UniCenter TNG and IPNet ConnectBOS/Storage etc.-Ali."

  "ConEd Lakewood Deal (PJM East)": [
    "I asked ConEd if they were prepared to hear our OFFER to buy peaking capacity from the Lakewood expansion.  They are \"in the midst of preparing a draft term sheet for purchasing the output/tolling\" so we'll have to wait to see the parameters of sale.I also asked if they would like to see PJM WEST synthetic toll offer from us.  Unfortunately, NO.To the extent it matters, the on-line date is now set for late 2002, so they would like to see our offer for a Jan '03 start date.  Given that these guys are doing a real comparison against bricks and mortar, we would be looking at a $63 million option premium for 500MW @ 3.50/KW-mo over a three-year term; $84 million for a four-year term, I would hope we could be able to find a way to hedge the risk of too many $500 hours killing us.  Is there any cap we could buy to protect our downside risk here and still make this deal attractive?  The heat rate call is struck at 10,900!"

  "Continental Briefing for Enron/Continental meeting December 12th": [
    "jennifer.medcalf@enron.comjennifer.medcalf@enron.comIn preparation for the meeting on December 12th with Larry Kellner, CFO,Continental Airlines, I have noted below some background on theEnron/Continental relationship and the purpose for the meeting.  Mr.Shankman, please advise if you would like me to distribute this to theattendees.Over the past several years Enron has been hedging Continental's crude oil.The relationship has been beneficial to both sides.  As a result, since 1999Enron has made over $9 million and Continental has saved over $45 million.The purpose for the December 12th meeting is to address three initiatives in(3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis.   Several new initiatives beingexchanging call options on crude oil for airline tickets (Craig Breslau,Originator)transacting financial swaps on line (Larry Gagliardi, Originator)creating a weather derivative product for the airline industry (Mark Tawneyand Gary Taylor, Originators)outsourcing Continental's antifreeze and plastics risks by hedging theseproducts with Enron (Alan Engberg, Originator)Ron Howard, Vice President, Food ServicesLarry Kellner, Chief Financial OfficerGreg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management CompanyJeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)Jeff Shankman, President and COO, Enron Global MarketsJohn Nowlan, Vice President, Enron Global MarketsCraig Breslau, Vice President, Enron North AmericaMark Tawney, Director, Enron Global Markets (tentative)(Developed through conversations with Alan Engberg, Larry Gagliardi, GaryTaylor, Craig Breslau, Tracy Ramsey and Lucy Ortiz.)Current Enron verifiable spend on Continental airline tickets wasapproximately $40 million in FY 1999 and $17.5 million for the first sixmonths of 2000.managing a strong relationship with Greg Hartford, VP, Continental FuelManagement, hedging Continental's crude oil.  The first transaction was onJanuary 14, 1998 -- a one month Forward on Kero.  Since then, Enron hasbusiness consists of three crude call options, settling in December 2000($31.00) and January, 2001 ($34.00 and $35.00)2000)on crude oil for airline tickets.Rick Pressly, Director, Continental Fuel Management, regarding financial jetswaps on line.   At the time, Pressly was not interested in pursuing thisproduct offering.with crude oil since hedging jet fuel with jet is a more perfect hedge.Enron could offer services for the whole year and explore multi-year optionsas well both with financial and physical jet fuel.could also supply Continental with jet fuel physical in the followinglocations such as the US Gulf Coast, New York harbor, the US West Coast, andEurope.  (Enron is doing this now with Delta airlines in New York harbor).If so, Gagliardi could provide a guest password and Enron Onlineidentification number if Kellner's office wanted to review the product.aggregate bad weather above a tolerable level would result in payment fromEnron to Continental.Continental Airlines clearly has exposure to weather as indicated in theirannual reports and periodic press releases - particularly those discussingearnings.  It is extremely difficult to envision the perfect weather hedgefor all of Continental's weather related exposure.  However, it is notdifficult to envision simple ways to reduce a large portion of it.Continental has hubs in Houston, Newark, and Cleveland.  The weatherconditions that create delays and increased costs in these areas include -rainfall above certain amounts, snowfall above certain amounts, temperaturesbelow freezing (de-icing costs), winds above a certain speed, etc.various groups within Continental to describe what weather conditions affectthe bottom line, how much they affect the bottom line, and then ask eachgroup to attach a \"confidence level\" to each of their estimates - Continentalcould start a weather risk management program by only hedging a weightedaverage of their exposure x their confidence level - or some portion thereof.Clear exposure.  Quantifiable.Clear exposure.  Difficult to quantifyPotential exposure.  QuantifiablePotential exposure.  Difficult to quantifyFor each of the above categories, Enron would also need an indication ofwhether Continental has historical cost data against which we can regresshistorical weather data.Enron's weather derivatives team could then sit down with Kirk Rummel,Director and Airport Services Division Controller, and some of his team (orothers designated by Kellner) and brainstorm about different types of weatherthat cause increased cost to Continental.  (Gary Taylor made a briefpresentation to Rummel on November 6th; no follow up action with Enron hastaken place to date)their antifreeze risk (ethylene glycol / propylene glycol) and plastics (highimpact polystyrene, polyethylene) by hedging those products with Enron.their purchase contracts are linked to the index used for hedging) andassociated reduction in volatility of cash flowshedged 100% of their 4 million pound polystyrene exposure.  Since Continentalhas not yet shared the size of their antifreeze buy, Engberg cannot commenton the potential value to Enron though he is fairly certain it would be muchlarger than $2 million.Possible next stepsThis proposition is being considered by Ron Howard's team at Continental.Continental needs to share their antifreeze spend with Enron.  Enron couldthen develop a proposal to Continental that includes perceived benefits ofoutsourcing their commodity risk to Enron.  Could a follow-up meeting withRon Howard's team and Larry Kellner's designated contact be arranged tofacilitate this process?Alan Engberg also recommends working with Continental on a strategic approachto modelling their overall exposures using VaR may prove extremely powerfuland rewarding to both companies.  David Port is already (x-39823)  looking atways to outsource Enron's expertise in this area.  Continental could be apioneer in the effort.  Factors to model wouldinclude jet fuel, natural gas, electricity, currency, interest rates,plastics, antifreeze, paper, and, metal."

  "Critics Seek More Control Over ISO": [

Though generally praised for keeping lights on in theface of severe shortages of electricity, the ISO has come under fire forfailing to move more quickly to lower the maximum price it will paygenerators for emergency power to meet demand and prevent blackouts.Pressure on the ISO has eased considerably since last week, when itsgoverning board voted to lower the cap on such same-day, emergency purchases-- the only type of pricing it has the power to affect directly -- to $250 amegawatt hour from $500. But the heat hasn't been turned off completely. Somelawmakers still are calling for changes in the 26-member ISO board, whichincludes people nominated by power generators, utilities, middlemen, andcommercial and residential customers, among others. The critics want tostreamline the board and make it more accountable to the state's electedofficials.The ISO was created by the state's 1996 utility-deregulation act to transmitelectricity smoothly between generators and utilities. Lawmakers devised theindependent board as a way to give the various \"stakeholders\" -- generators,utilities, middlemen, customers and environmentalists -- a say in how energyis supplied. Members serve for up to three years.\"It's inappropriate for the ISO governing board to vote on issues thatbenefit them financially,\" says Sen. Dede Alpert, a Coronado Democrat. Shequestions the wisdom of allowing out-of-state energy sellers and marketers tosit on the ISO board and vote on emergency prices, especially when they havean interest in keeping those prices high.Sen. Alpert spent much of the Legislature's recent summer recess fieldingcomplaints about high electricity costs from her constituents, customers ofSan Diego Gas & Electric Co., a unit of San Diego-based Sempra Energy. Lastsummer, SDG&E became the first investor-owned utility in the state to haveprice regulations fully lifted. This summer, its rates have doubled, as hightemperatures and power shortages have swept the West.In response to a series of price spikes in Southern California and the widercontention that skyrocketing prices indicate the failure of deregulation,state lawmakers have scheduled a joint hearing tomorrow in Sacramento. Highof the way it handles power statewide on hot days. Critics say emergencypurchases should be no more than 5% of electric-power sales, but were as highas 33% of the market on hot days earlier this summer.Key legislative leaders -- including Sen. Steve Peace, an El Cajon Democratwho was the architect of the 1996 deregulation law -- would like to make theISO more accountable to state elected officials.Possible changes include preventing industry representatives with conflictsfrom sitting on the ISO board, as well as abolishing the ISO entirely andshifting its responsibilities back to state utilities, under the supervisionof the state Public Utilities Commission. Until 1996, the PUC regulated allelectric utility rates and services.ISO board members say legislative critics are unfairly focusing anger overthe price spikes on the ISO, which has only a limited ability to set prices.Most electricity isn't sold through the same-day, emergency market -- butthrough long-term contracts between sellers and utilities, or at least a dayin advance through the California Power Exchange, which is a nonprofitcorporation established by the 1996 law to serve as a trading floor.\"We need to create a government structure that is not susceptible to pressurefrom one state senator or anyone else,\" to keep prices artificially low, saysISO Chairman Jan Smutney-Jones, who represents the Independent EnergyProducers Association, the trade group for non-utility power generators. Hedismisses criticism of the board's out-of-state members. There needs to be\"an independent, interstate board\" because energy is transmitted across statelines, he says. Two Houston-based power sellers on the board, Dynegy Corp.and Enron Corp., deny any conflict. Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chiefexecutive, blames state officials for expanding the ISO's role to includemonitoring prices. \"If there's any finger-pointing,\" Mr. Watson says, \"theyprobably should start with the big finger pointed right at them.\"Substantial restructuring of ISO governance could prove difficult. The state,through the governor-appointed Electricity Oversight Board, has limited powerto make changes. Past efforts by the Oversight Board to exert control didn'tgo far.Last year, state lawmakers tried to give the Oversight Board the power toconfirm or reject ISO board members to make them accountable to stateofficials. (Nominees had previously gone on automatically.) The effort wasopposed by officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission inWashington, D.C., which argued that the state couldn't have veto power overthe nominees of out-of-state power producers. In a compromise, Californiaofficials were given authority to veto half the board -- those nominated byresidential, industrial, commercial and agricultural power-users.The federal energy commission has final regulatory authority over the ISO andhas viewed state attempts to meddle with the agency as an unconstitutionalattempt to hinder interstate commerce.Any proposed changes in ISO's governing structure \"would be looked at veryclosely by FERC,\" says ISO attorney Richard Jacobs.This summer, the ISO board displayed an independence that was annoying tostate lawmakers. In June, Sen. Peace called on the board to lower its pricecap for emergency purchases, from $750 a megawatt hour (roughly the amount ofelectricity needed to power 1,000 homes) to $250. The board responded bylowering the cap to $500 a megawatt hour. A second attempt to lower the capto $250 failed to get a majority vote.The reason? The three private power-seller representatives, including theIndependent Energy Producers Association, were joined by those representingagricultural, industrial and commercial users in opposing a lowering of thecap.Then, the pressure on the ISO board really intensified. Gov. Gray Davisweighed in, by sending the ISO board a letter asking it to lower the cap \"tothe lowest possible level.\" Energy Secretary Bill Richardson ordered therepresentative of federal-public-power sellers to change his vote from no toyes. A consumer representative from the League of Women Voters also moved tothe \"aye\" column, allowing the cap to be lowered to $250.Lowering the cap removes some of the rate pressure on residential andcommercial consumers in San Diego -- and takes some of the heat off the ISOelectricity market that was sent to the governor after the vote said that themembers of the ISO and the Power Exchange boards \"can have serious conflictsof interest\" and that both organization aren't \"accountable to the state orits consumers.\"An ISO spokesman said the board is in the process of producing a formalresponse to the report and it declined to comment. A spokesman for the PowerExchange said that it has followed the law regarding conflicts and that itdoes protect consumers.---"

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British ColumbiaHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwestregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paidabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.But that still wasn't enough juice.The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawattsof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawattsof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the$250/MWh price cap.The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. Themunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess powerinto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWPis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suitclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal BonnevillePower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into themarket at prices 10 times higher.Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying alltransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the stateno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is havingto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willingto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday duringa conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergencyWednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declaredwhen the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power isinterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only asa means of attracting additional electricity resources.\"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\"Dorinson said.Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energyunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost ofthe high-priced power.SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to highwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow bynearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retailcustomers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricityrates or if companies will absorb the costs.-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncPwr Plant(This article was originally published Wednesday)LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California IndependentSystem Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke EnergyCorp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the statesince Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for thereasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to theISO.The ISO manages grid reliability.As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alertat 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state woulddip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid gridcollapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rollingblackouts.The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),Reliant Energy Inc.

The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergencyfor the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% andcustomers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may becalled on to do so.As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesdayevening.Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AESand Dynegy Tuesday evening.AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspectionof the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesdaymorning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman AaronThomas said.Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representativesreturned Wednesday for a full inspection.AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions CreditsThe Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities haveused up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken downtwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air QualityManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,Thomas said.AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entireHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitosand Redondo Beach plants.The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AEShas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine thecompany $20 million for polluting.\"We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,\"Thomas said. \"It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air qualitydistrict's\" authority.As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AEScould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its offline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUCDynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesdayevening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off lineWednesday.\"I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if youneed to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'\" said Dynegyspokesman Lynn Lednicky.Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance andthe other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which couldpose a safety hazard if not repaired.\"We've been doing all we can to get back in service,\" Lednicky said. \"Weeven paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.\"Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation ofwhy its units were off line.-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,jessica.berthold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

The difference betweenwhat SDG&Ecustomers would pay under the legislation and what SDG&E is paying forsupplies inthe skyrocketing electricity markets has been estimated at $1.5 billion.Assembly Passage Of Measure UncertainThe legislation would roll back electricity rates to June 1, 1999, levelsfor customers ofSDG&E, a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE). This spring and summer, the utility'scustomers have received electricity bills that are nearly triple what theywere last year.Electricity rates for the state's other utilities haven't been deregulatedyet, so theircustomers are receiving fixed prices per kilowatt-hour of power used.Prospects for passage of the bill, AB 2290, are unclear in the Assembly.The CaliforniaState Senate passed the bill unanimously last week. But it would need 54votes to passthrough the 80-member Assembly before Gov. Gray Davis could considersigning it intolaw.If all 47 Democrats approve the measure, it would need at least sevenRepublican votesto pass. But, as reported Tuesday, only three Republican lawmakers saidthey wouldsupport the bill.The rollback would provide some economic relief to SDG&E's 1.1 millioncustomers,who have been paying market-based rates for electricity since June. If therollback isapproved, utility bills for residential customers would be about $55 to $60a month,according to SDG&E.Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said the governor hasn't decidedwhether hewould sign the bill into law if approved.Monday, the state's Public Utilities Commission rejected a proposal to rollback rates,instead approving a stabilization rate plan that would reduce the cost ofelectricity toabout $68 a month for residential customers who conserve usage.-By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604;mark.golden@dowjones.comCopyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

The current cap was lowered to $250/MWhfrom $500/MWh starting August 7.The ISO wouldn't confirm that it had to pay more than $250 Monday.\"We're not going to reveal whether this is happening, or at what price,\"spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkel told Dow Jones Newswires. \"For the sake ofprotecting consumers, we will keep our price strategy confidiential. But anyout-of-market purchase above the cap is very rare.\"On Sunday, the ISO agreed to pay about $350/MWh at Palo Verde to a southwestutility for on-peak Monday power, according to a trader for the utility, whospoke on the condition of anonymity. Bilateral trades not involving the ISOwere done as high as $375/MWh Monday afternoon in the real-time market.Other market sources said that the ISO exceeded its cap again Tuesdayafternoon, when several major California generating units were be taken offline for unplanned repairs, and the real-time market rose to $500/MWh forone hour at Palo Verde.

Surging power prices plaguingthe state this summer \"do not reflect legitimate forces of supply anddemand,\" SDG&E said, calling on FERC to impose across-the-board electricityprice caps in California of $250 per megawatt-hour indefinitely until themarket flaws are corrected.  But the power producers rejected SDG&E'sanalysis of the market problems as \"simplistic,\" and called the impositionof price caps on all California power sales an unwarranted response to thepower supply shortage.  \"SDG&E asks the commission to take unreasonable andunprecedented action that would effectively rescind every Californiasupplier's authority to sell energy and ancillary services at market-basedrates,\" complained Southern Energy California, a subsidiary of Southern Co.(SO).  \"A strict cap will only exacerbate the current supply shortages inCalifornia,\" Southern Energy and the other power suppliers argued.  \"Theimposition of this cap by FERC may discourage power developers from choosingto serve California markets,\" said Dynegy Power Marketing Inc. (DYN).  \"Thecap may also convince (electricity users they) need not participate inload-reduction programs, since paying the $250 price cap is cheaper thanshedding load,\" Dynegy told the commission.  \"The imposition of caps onevery California market, and the increased uncertainty as to when - if ever- they might be removed, sends precisely the wrong message to potentialsuppliers of energy in California,\" Southern Energy said.  The arguments ofthe individual power producers in the state were echoed by the ElectricPower Supply Association, the national trade group representing competitivepower producers and marketers.  Imposing price caps in California's volatileelectricity prices would \"suffocate markets\" and do nothing to address thechronic power-supply shortages causing prices to spike, EPSA told FERC.\"The relief SDG&E seeks would actually prolong and intensify California'sdifficulties,\" EPSA said.  Price caps would discourage electricity importsand investment in new power plants to supply the state, while discouragingprice risk management, liquidity and accurate price signals, EPSA said.FERC has already allowed the California Independent System Operator to capthe price it is willing to pay for power, which it uses to assure the gridoperates properly and to make up \"energy imbalances\" on the system.  The ISOrecently lowered its purchase price cap to $250 per megawatt-hour. The SDG&Epetition asks FERC to extend that cap to the state's power exchange, or PX,which operates as a clearinghouse for wholesale power sales in California.\"A PX bid cap is unnecessary because the ISO purchase price cap hashistorically acted as a de facto cap on the PX markets,\" Dynegy told FERC.-By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647;bryan.lee@dowjones.comCopyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

We're going to be in trouble.\"Thanks to a break in this summer's high temperatures in California, the ISOmanaged to find the power it needed Monday and bought it under the new pricecap of $250 a megawatt-hour. It also looks to be able to make it throughTuesday.But the real test could come with higher temperatures forecast for Wednesdayand Thursday - or whenever the next heat wave comes.The state's power grid is run by the ISO, established by the state'slegislature to ensure that California's utilities were getting enough powerto meet their customer needs.Utilities typically buy most of the power they need a day in advance basedon weather forecasts and system capacity. A different state-charteredorganization, the California Power Exchange buys most of the power theutilities need one day ahead of time.The ISO is supposed plug unexpected gaps by purchasing marginal amounts ofpower on a last-minute basis as necessary.But the price cap is changing the way the game is played.Prices in the ISO's real-time market are capped at $250 a megawatt-hour. Butprices in the CalPX's day-ahead market are uncapped and free to skyrocket.As a result, California's main utilities - PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas& Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison andSempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric - will buy only thosesupplies available on the day-ahead market that are bid at the ISO cap orless.That policy makes sense - electricity is widely regarded as the mostvolatile commodity in existence, prices can rise 100-fold in a matter ofdays and California's prices are about four times their level last summer.But it isn't the most sustainable.Grid Operator Left To Cover Large ShortfallOn Monday, for example, the California PX reported that the utilities boughtall the power suppliers bid in below the price cap, a total of 27,500megawatts of supply for peak afternoon hours.But as the sun rose over the California sky and air conditioners ramped up,the three utilities needed 40,000 megawatts of power to meet demand -leaving the ISO not just to tweak the system, but to buy almost a third ofwhat was required.\"It makes it a lot harder for our people to operate the system,\" ISOspokesman Patrick Dorinson said.On Monday, the ISO had to leave its official, computer-based market andscramble to secure needed power supplies from neighboring utilities bytelephone, as it has done numerous times this summer.The question for California is whether independent generating companies andutilities outside the state will sell their power to the state at or belowthe $250 price cap, or whether they'll be able to sell their output for ahigher price elsewhere.Like much of the rest of the country, the western U.S. now needs moreelectricity during summer afternoons than it can generate. The boomingelectricity-driven new economy has been met with almost no additions togenerating capacity. Companies that have generating capacity are looking fortop dollar.\"Our real-time folks' job is to optimize revenue and get the highest pricefor that energy that they can,\" said Larry Bryant, spokesman for the PublicService Co. of New Mexico (PNM), which regularly sells power to California.\"There is no preference of customer. There's preference for maximizing therevenue that hour of that day.\"The $250 cap, half what it was until Monday and a third of what it was untilJuly 1, is well under prices the western wholesale power market has seenfrequently this summer.The ISO has the authority to break its own cap if necessary to keep thelights on, but doing so could make a shambles of the state's official powermarket.Traders at utilities with excess power to sell say they will have noincentive to bid in supply on the ISO's computer system at prices under thecap if they know the ISO will be picking up the phone later with sweeterdeals.\"At 10 a.m. the ISO operators have to run around and find a sufficientamount of capacity in the West to serve our needs, and on some days therereally is only a limited amount of capacity to go around,\" Smutny-Jonessaid.\"We're going to have figure out a better way of managing this,\" he added.-Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.comCopyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

PulizziOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRESWASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Now that gasoline prices are finally settling down,economists say another energy component could prove to be a spoiler on thegovernment's main consumer inflation gauge.Amid a shifting regulatory landscape and typical summertime price increases,the nation's utilities appear to be boosting consumers' electricity billsenough to skew the Labor Department's July consumer price index. Those gainswould partly offset the anticipated favorable influence of recentlydeclining gas prices.\"There is a real chance of starling increases in electricity prices over thenext month or two, thanks mostly to the bungled deregulation of theindustry,\" Ian Sheperdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economicsin Valhalla, N.Y., wrote in a recent report. \"All the anecdotal evidencefrom the West and East Costs suggests consumers are reeling from suddendouble - and in some cases triple - digit percentage increases in theirbills.\"it is a particular problem in the West.\" In California, where no new powerplants have been built in a decade, the private companies that purchasedplants from the state's utilities have been raising prices in response tostrong demand and dwindling supply.The impact of the cost increases will be revealed Wednesday, when the LaborDepartment releases the July CPI next Wednesday.Economists generally expect the figures to point to a continued tameinflation scenario - a 0.1% overall monthly increase, featuring decliningclothing, computer and gas prices is forecast. Labor Department economistPatrick Jackman said recent statistics suggest gas prices fell 3% to 3.5%last month. That would mark a departure from June, when soaring prices atthe nation's gas stations contributed to a big 0.6% spike in the CPI.Rising Demand, Surging PricesBut electricity, which represents 2.5% of the entire index, will be a wildcard in the coming report.Electricity costs usually rise in the summer as consumers pay more for thejuice that powers their air conditioners. This summer is no different,Vitner said, adding that utilities have even more pricing power than normal.\"Overall demand for electricity has been rising. All this high-techequipment uses a lot of electricity,\" Vitner said.Indeed, prices rose 0.8% in June after seasonal adjustments. Before thoseadjustments, prices surged a whopping 6.6% during the month.As for a July increase, Jackman said \"it certainly is a possibility. Thequestion is how are the seasonal factors are going to handle it.\"Sheperdson, however, believes it's clear that electricity costs are on therise. \"Three factors are driving prices higher,\" he said. \"First, flaws inthe auction system set up after deregulation effectively allow thegenerating companies to manipulate prices at times of high demand. Second,the economic boom means that periods of high demand are much more commonthan was anticipated at the time of deregulation, so generators have moreopportunity to extract premium prices from distributors and, hence,consumers. Third, little new electricity-generating capacity has been addedin recent years.\"Producer prices, which Sheperdson says provide a good guide to movements inthe CPI, may offer ominous insight into the potential consumer electricityprice gains. Residential electric power prices on the producer level rosefaster in July than at any point since January 1991.And they aren't expected to slow down anytime soon. August could beespecially problematic because higher electricity costs will coincide withanother pickup in gas prices and continued gains in natural gas prices,Vitner said.\"We have no idea how far the CPI measure of residential electricity pricescould rise, but there must be a good chance that substantial increases willbe recorded,\" Sheperdson said. \"With natural gas prices also climbing again,following a dip in July, it may take a while before energy ceases to pushinflation higher.\"-Henry J.

Since we last met we have been busy promoting the ideaof working with Enron on DealBench to our Supply Chain Service Lineleadership partners.   I believe we have convinced them that there is anice fit between Deal Bench and our own Auction Services play (known asDynamic Pricing Solutions or DPS).  We would like to get back together withyou and your team early next week, preferably Monday afternoon and Tuesdayto sort through the potential shape of an ongoing arrangement.  We believethe combination of Accenture's relationships, assets and book of businessin the Auction Services space creates a tremendous platform for helpingEnron generate value from your DealBench investment.  Our DPS groupprovides a ready made model for bringing Auction Services to the marketplace in a way that fully leverages our 15,000+ supply chain resources.As you and your team pointed out there are many options to forming arelationship going forward.  During our meetings with you we would like tofurther explore the manner in which we might work together to collectivelyservice the marketplace.   The possibilities to consider would be the itemsDealBench/Accenture Marketing AllianceDealBench/Accenture Special Purpose VehicleOur initial view is that the Special Purpose Vehicle is likely to be theoptimum structure.  This view is based on the fact that we both havesimilar assets, resources and market potential that would likely fittogether in a combination of some kind very well.  We see working togetherbut with separate competitive offerings or simply the addition of anothertool to our offering as limiting over the long term.As a path forward, I have asked our DPS group to work with us to develop asynergistic play.  They are available early next week to provide you andyour team an overview of the offerings we are currently providing to themarketplace.  After we demonstrate our DPS offering we can discuss theappropriate aspects of the Special Purpose Vehicle and if appropriatedetermine the go forward approach.  It is our view that both parties wouldassign dedicated resources to drive out the structure, business plan(including offering scope, operating model, cost estimates, capitalrequirements) and overall initial contributions of the parties.  We thinkthis effort could be completed in 1 or 2 weeks at most.We are excited about the possibilities of working with Enron on thisinitiative and appreciate your willingness to work with Accenture.  I willbe calling you later today to set-up the logistics for the discussions nextweek.  I will ask our people to come to Houston for these meetings.

  "DealBench 2/2 auction failure cause and solution": [
    "Louise -Below is the report on yesterday's DealBench issues.  Please let me know ifyou would like further information.- Dan-----Original Message-----Event Sequence? Lot 1 of two Sabre auctions went through without issues? Between Lots, there was a scheduled 15 minute interval.  About 10 minutesinto this period, developers monitoring the system saw errors showing up onthe View Deal page.  Within minutes, users reported the same problemreentering the Sabre deal.  The rest of the site was unaffected? Within five minutes, the problem was isolated to the document management? Restart the process that returns documents? Move the documents off the deal? Create a second deal, same structure as the first, but without thedocuments.? The auction on the second Lot started approximately 40 minutes late.  Oncestarted, it continued without further errors through several auctionextensions, finally resulting in a $500K savings for Sabre.Cause? Document management process stopped returning documents and was insteadreturning null values.  This caused the View Deal page to appear \"hung\". TheDocument to be served was the \"deal agent logo\", a special document type thatis displayed at the top of the page.Contributing Factors? The run.bat script, which launches the document management Java process,was not logging its status? The SQL statement that retrieves the deal agent logo did not correctlyhandle the special case of a document file being moved.  Therefore, movingthe deal agent logo to another deal did not solve the error.? run.bat had never failed previously, and the process had been runningconsistently for over 60 days.  Therefore it was not initially suspected as aproblem source.Fixes? An immediate stop-work on further enhancements to DealBench until systemstability has been addressed? Isolate document management process in the test environment, and thoroughlytest all possible failure scenarios.? Start logging and tracking of run.bat script and document management process? Make document management process fully redundant, so it will failover inthe event of error? Increase monitoring on new log files? Initiate an in-depth architectural review with Kevin Montagne's team, toidentify further areas to improve system robustness"

  "DealBench DataRoom Summary": [
    "rosalinda.gonzalez@enron.comrosalinda.gonzalez@enron.comHi all,I just wanted to sum up our discussions from yesterday.Enron Global Assets is considering using DealBench for hosting virtualdatarooms for the divestiture of 32 international assets. The projected totalnumber of documents will be in the region of 3500. DealBench has offered tohost these datarooms at a cost of $25k per dataroom. This is on the basisthat you are hosting all 32 datarooms, as we have worked some steep discountsinto the pricing. The term of the dataroom hosting services under this offeris for the year 2001.We have also offered to help with the transition of the data to the improveddataroom platform once that is in place sometime in Q2.You have mentioned that a few documents that you intend to upload are biggerthan 8MB. We have discussed that we can lift the current file size ceiling togreater than 8MB. I just want to make you aware that for users of theplatform with slower connections it will be extremely time consuming todownload these files. Even under ideal circumstances it will take al least 5minutes for a 15MB file to download. For users with slower connections itwill potentially seem like the download has failed, even though the downloadis still in progress. This could result in a lot of calls to you and ourhelp-desk.As I mentioned it might be of value to you to have professional assistancewith the conversion of your paper documents to PDF. We are working togetherwith a company in Houston that could help in the conversion process. From ourexperience file size and quality of scans are greatly improved by outsourcingthis function. This is especially true if one is performing an OCR process onthe TIFF files during conversion to PDF.In the light of the urgency of your projects it might be a good idea to startthe dataroom preparation process as soon as possible. May I ask why yousuggested to wait until March to get back in contact with us ?If you have any questions feel free to give me a call at 713-345-4147. We arevery excited in helping you to deliver a world class solution.ThanksTobias Munk"

This year,communications equipment shipments fell by 22 percent, thelargest single year drop since the 1950s.With capital spending budgets getting slashed for 2002, analystsare forecasting another three percent decline in equipment salesnext year. If that happens, it would be first time ever thatcommunications equipment sales dropped in two consecutive years.Investors willing to stick with the industry will have a toughtime singling out companies that can provide value under existingconditions.Investors may have to brace themselves, but service may outpace price in customers' valuesBy Dave Sterman, equity research columnistWho'll be the first to blink? Analysts aren't really focused onthis issue yet, but price wars may be looming in the wirelesssector, scrambling the sector and confounding expectations.Sprint PCS (PCS), Nextel (NXTL), AT&T Wireless (AWE), Verizon(VZ), Cingular (a joint venture between BellSouth (BLS) and SBC(SBC)) and VoiceStream (a unit of Deutsche Telecom (DT)) areclose to completing their respective nationwide expansion plans.That means that consumers in almost every major metropolitan areanow have at least three or four wireless carriers from which tochoose. And that means it won't be too long before these firmsstart scrambling to poach each other's customers.Unless these carriers can show remarkable restraint, price warscould soon become the dominant theme in the sector.A plethora of smaller companies are nipping at its heels, but all they may get is boneBy Dave Sterman, equity research columnistWhat do Juniper Networks (JNPR), Foundry Networks (FDRError!Hyperlink reference not valid.Y), Extreme Networks (EXTR) andRiverstone Networks (RSTN) have in common? They all sport amarket capitalization in excess of $1 billion (despite themassive tech sell-off of the last 18 months), and they all toilin the looming shadow of Cisco Systems (CSCO).Although growth investors continually check the pulse of theseother tech upstarts, they can't do research in a vacuum. As goesCisco, so goes these networkers.To be sure, these companies can try and wrest a few points ofmarket share from Cisco. But if the market for switches androuters doesn't rebound sharply, share gains will result in onlya minor revenue uptick. And no one has greater visibility intothe direction of the networking market than Cisco. So when CiscoCEO John Chambers speaks, the sector listens.Three telcos in Korea are well positioned for long-term growth and attracting analyst interest.By Ben Mattlin, equity research columnistA recent report from CLSA Emerging Markets (Dec. 13, 2001) hailedSouth Korea as \"one of the world's leading telecom markets.\" Thereport cited the rapid growth of both cellular and broadband inthis nation of 50 million, and ended with the rhetoricalquestion, \"Isn't it an obvious market in which to be overweight?\"A quick screening of international telcos with an average analystrating of 2 (\"buy\") or better confirms the assertion; in fact,there are three companies passing this screen that are based inSouth Korea.======================== Sponsored by =========================What do you want from a broker?

INVESTMENT IDEASIt's playing long in PeoriaMedia issues tend to anticipate a recovery, but somestocks are already over-boughtBy Charles Payne, principal analyst, Wall Street StrategiesThe media group is one that investors should watch very closely over thenext several months. These stocks are known as early cyclical issuesbecause their share price usually improves long before the broadeconomy does. However, other cyclical sectors have actually seen theirfortunes turn in anticipation of the economy, while media stocks ingeneral have been sluggish. Last week the big names in the group weredowngraded by Credit Suisse First Boston, as much because of internalissues as because of macro conditions. Ad sales on television are nowestimated to be off by 8 percent, while only a few weeks ago mostindustry observers thought the sales number would be off by 5 percent.In fact, for the next couple of months, it is believed that prime time spotsfor the networks will decrease by 30 percent. Nevertheless, if thesestocks live up to their reputation and outperform up to nine monthsbefore the broad economy improves, there could be reason to discountthe current bad news and look at the group as an intermediate to long-term investment.Click here to read more.2.

They all sport a market capitalization in excess of $1 billion(despite the massive tech sell-off of the last 18 months), and they all toilin the looming shadow of Cisco Systems (CSCO).Although growth investors continually check the pulse of these othertech upstarts, they can't do research in a vacuum.

INVESTMENT IDEASBroadband providers hit the canvasDSL has fumbled the ball and cable has hit the deck, but the refhasn't counted them out...yetBy Ben Macklin, senior analyst, eMarketerIt has been a tough year for broadband access providers in the US.On the digital subscriber line (DSL) front, wholesalers RhythmsNet Connections (RTHMQ), North Point and Covad(COVD.OB) hit the canvas.  Covad is in the process of gettingback on its feet, but its future remains uncertain.  On the cable side,Excite@Home recently filed for bankruptcy, and numerousbroadband wireless providers including Winstar and Metricomhave also dissolved.  But what lies ahead for those that survive?While DSL technology has fumbled the ball early in the game andis now unlikely to ever live up to its promise, cable and satelliteproviders still have a chance to run for daylight. But for the timebeing, dial-up remains the clear market leader.Indeed, eMarketer predicts continuing growth in the dial-up sector,at least for 2002, even though broadband services will becomemore widespread. Dial-up will taper off in the following years, butit will still be the most common means of Internet access in thehome even as late as 2004.  AOL, with its 26 million subscribers(not counting Road Runner) as of September 2001, will continue todominate the scene. Its nearest competitors, MSN (7 millionsubscribers), United Online (6.1 million subscribers) andEarthlink (ELNK) (4.9 million subscribers) will battle it out forsecond place.

This is in line withconsensus expectations and the \"flash\" estimate published by Eurostatearlier in the month. Euro area core inflation (CPI less all food andenergy) accelerated to 2.3% in October from 2.2% in September. Thiswas above initial consensus estimates of 2.2% but probably widelyexpected following preliminary French and German national CPI datawhich indicated higher core inflation.The rise in core inflation is clearly an issue for the ECB but wewould expect them to play down the acceleration in core inflation andfocus instead on the fall in headline inflation. Headline inflationwas 2.0% or below in 4 economies in October, up from 3 in September.The ECB expects headline inflation to decelerate sharply during early2002 - the recent declines in oil prices, if sustained, are likely toadd to that sentiment.  We expect slower growth leading to lowerpipeline inflation pressures along with base effects to generate firmexpectations of a marked decline in inflation during 2002. Thisunderpins our expectation of a further 50bp of policy rate cuts fromthe ECB in Q1 2002."

Read about********************News Brief+High Cost of Oil and Natural Gas Puts FPL $518 Million Behind in FuelExpense RecoveryFaced with skyrocketing oil and natural gas prices and heavy seasonal demandfor electricity, Florida Power & Light Company has filed preliminarypaperwork with the Florida Public Service Commission identifying $518million in expenses above projections for fuel burned to produce electricityin 2000. FPL will file with the Commission in September for permission torecover the expense in customer bills beginning Jan. 1, 2001.Part of this increase will be offset by a refund to customers that iscurrently estimated to be $75 million to $100 million. The refund ispursuant to an agreement reached in April 1999 with the Office of the PublicCounsel and the FPSC that provides for revenue sharing between FPL and itscustomers, as well as a 6% annual rate reduction for three years. As aresult of the forecasted fuel costs and the expected rebate, residentialelectric rates could increase by approximately 13% per kilowatt-hour.The cost of oil used to generate electricity has more than doubled since thefirst quarter of 1999 and has not been this high since the Gulf War in 1990.Since January 2000, oil prices have increased 44% per barrel. Natural gasprices also have risen unabated, climbing 77% since January 2000. With theonset of winter, natural gas prices may increase further as demand forheating fuel increases./////////////////////Market Brief    Thursday August 24Stocks  Close   Change  % ChangeDJIA    11,182.74       38.1    0.3DJ 15 Util.     358.51  (5.7)   (1.6)NASDAQ  4,053.28        42.3    1.1S&P 500 1,508.31        2.3     0.2Market Vols     Close   Change  % ChangeAMEX (000)      50,373  (7,710.0)       (15.3)NASDAQ (000)    1,548,008       85,370.0        5.5NYSE (000)      825,146 (41,307.0)      (5.0)Commodities     Close   Change  % ChangeCrude Oil (Oct) 31.63   (0.39)  (1.23)Heating Oil (Sep)       0.9533  (0.00)  (0.29)Nat.

    "After our meeting with Dell on 10/27, I sent a request to Charlie Ball (worksfor Kip) for detailed power data from TXU. Charlie delegated the task ofgetting this data to Randy Don Carlos, who has yet to return any of my callsto update the status of the request.Charlie Ball left me a message this morning indicating that Randy Don Carloswas leaving Dell at the end of the month. He indicated that he will get theinformation to me as soon as he can. I'm not sure, but it seems that no onehas sent the request to TXU yet. TXU generally will send out data within 1-2weeks of a request. It has now been 6 weeks since we asked Dell for the data.Assuming Charlie actually gets someone to send the data request to TXU, weshould get something by the end of the year.Similarly, Continental has not yet sent over data that they were to requestfrom HL&P. I talked with someone in Mark's group on 12/4, and she indicatedthat they had the data, but their real estate group wanted to review itbefore they sent it to us. On this one also, it is unlikely that anytransaction will get done in this calendar year.Please call if you have any questions."

  "EBS opp'ty w/BMC": [
    "Chaz & Steve,I was able to review our recently completed conference call w/BMC withJennifer Medcalf.During the call, Bernie Goicoechea and Ann(e?) Munson expressed that duringtheir last few months of interaction with Enron Net Works, they haveattempted to understand the exact issues and concerns which Net Works haswith regard to selection/use of BMC's products.  Bernie voiced that he hasn'tbeen able to get more detail on the problems or nature of concerns that NetWorks has, beyond what you and I know.  The BMC account team feels thatwithout specifics, they cannot address the issues accurately or in a timelyfashion.The Enron Net Works team has expressed concern that various BMC products arenot Windows 2000 certified (at least, not the ones they are focused on, andnot in writing).  Net Works also have some other concerns relative to the(Net Works) team's feelings that the BMC products (in some areas) \"...haven'tkept up with the industry\", and that they (Net Works) have some residualissues with the BMC account support in general.  Bottom Line, expressed byNet Works, is that there is a low probability of their purchasing enough BMCsoftware product this year to enable EBS to clinch its deal with BMC.You related Jim Crowder's suggestion related to the use of indemnificationand liquidated damages clauses being implemented.  Jennifer and I discussedthis situation, and our meetings with your team, in context.  We have afor Net Works in the form of \"advance purchase\" of BMC product.For example, EBS is poised to buy about $1 million worth of BMC software, butneeds to show BMC a firm purchase commitment for about $3 million in totalEnron purchases from BMC.  A way in which you could reach the $3 million markwith BMC; while also allowing the relationships between Net Works and BMCsoftware, but $1 million is used to actually take product now, and the other$2 million is used as a \"future purchases\" fund, in which EBS buys, but doesnot take immediate delivery of, the (remaining $2 million worth of) currentsoftware...THEN, future Enron Net Works (and any other ENE business unit) purchases ofBMC software would be executed such that EBS is paid, and the software isdelivered from/by BMC.  That way, EBS gets its $2 million back, the otherbusiness units aren't spending any of today's dollars for product which theyseem to have some concerns about (but they can get current/certified productwhen they need it in the future).  In addition, you secure the business withBMC right now.  I'm sure you could also figure out how to account for thetime value of money in this, so that there is further leverage advantage toyou.If all else fails, you may wish to consider something like this...In themeantime, we will continue along the current path and keep you posted onprogress.Thanks,JeffJeff YoungfleshDirector, Business DevelopmentGlobal Strategic SourcingEnron Corp.333 Clay Street, 11th FloorHouston, TX 77002"

Enron has givenpermission for this firm to handle this, but they need further approval fromeach one of you to deal with your backoffice people and with your assistantsin compiling this information to complete their project.  Below is a moredetailed letter from the firm explaining their work here.Please respond to me that I have your approval to give for them to completeyour project.Thank You,Ina Rangel---------------------------Sarah Bolken@ENRONWe are records and information management consultants from Millican &Associates, who have been hired by Carolyn Gilley, ENA's Records Manager, toformulate a Fileplan for all of ENA's business records. The approach we'retaking to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic  inventory of eachENA organization's records. Now, we generally meet with an executive (usuallya vice president, director or manager) within each group to first explainthis project and seek permission to perform the inventory. We'll then askthat executive to designate someone within his/her area to serve as ourworking contact. The contact is usually someone who is very familiar withtheir department's record, and can be a manager or support staff.There are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan Project.Enron, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronicrecords--much of it has never been captured on a records retention schedule.Many departments are keeping records well beyond their legal retentionrequirements, taking up valuable and expensive office space. The Fileplan,once completed, will document what is being created, who has responsibilityfor it, and how long it must be maintained.Enron has also invested in a software product called Livelink. Livelink is animaging system whereby you can scan your documents into it, index them, andthen use the \"imaged\" document viewable from your computer as the workingcopy. After scanning, the paper can either be destroyed or transferred tooffsite storage, depending upon its retention requirements.During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronicrecords. We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area uses, i.e.MSA, SAP, etc.. The inventory itself is painless and non-invasive, in that wedo not open or look into file cabinets or desk drawers. It's simply aninterview process where the contact answers a few easy, simple questions.If you have any additional questions, please feel free to give me a call.Thank you.Sara BolkenX35150"

  "ENA Meeting and Event Expenditure Approval Process": [
    "The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expendituresin excess of $5,000 has enabled ENA to better assess the business value ofevents, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events includecustomer and employee meetings, and trade shows.ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in thismemo.The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, thethreshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to$2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings andevents, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customerevents with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee eventswith anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA PublicRelations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contractnegotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR departmentwill work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or theycan provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR departmentwill be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your programand ENA.3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supportingdocumentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require adetailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Pleasesubmit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PRdepartment at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete theform.4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office ofthe Chairman for final approval.Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets forvarious local sporting events and concerts.If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistanceplanning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact DorieHitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.Thank you for your cooperation."

    "John,I called Ben and left a msg to call you in reagrds to the below email.Dutch-----Original Message-----Dutch,I am working on pulling together due diligence information for Global Finance in regards to ENA trading activity.  One number that stood out to us on the ENA PRMA detail was the Q4 2000 settlement of approximately negative $500MM.  We discussed possible reasons for this figure with the ENA accounting group, and they suggested it might be the Dec 2000 Nymex settlement, which was more that negative $600MM.  They suggested that I could contact you for further insight.  Would you have a few minutes sometime today to talk about that settlement?Thanks,Ben5-2047"

It hardly seems possible that  we are anotherweek on  already such has been the pace of activity here . The  ebb and flowin the Ali  market both in the spreads and outright price have kept  ourvaliant dealers on their toes  as  seemingly the whole market  vies to  availitself of our  pricing and liquidity services on-line ! .   Daily volumeshave  continued to grow with  over 800  separate transactions being seentoday! .  In fact volumes have risen by approximately  56% since Decemberfrom a daily average  of 357 to a daily average of 557  for January .At thesame time the regular Non-EOL transaction count has decreased from about 1800trades a day to 1586 trades  since December.    Your efforts at getting  theregistered customers who had not  completed an on line trade are beginningto  pay dividends  finally - but the migration remains painfully slow . Keepplugging awayThe graph  above illustrates the growth of our  average daily onlinetransaction volumes  in relation to our regular transaction volume on amonthly basis  from July of 99 to date .This week's daily  transaction volume  is another  record and   but for theblip on Monday  which put down to the  Mother's day in Africa  holiday  wouldhave been sensational .We have asked for your response to several queries over the past three weeksand have received little or no  reaction.  Consequently we shall ask again.Metals Conferences you believe would be beneficial for Enron metals toattend, speak at and/ or have metals or EnronOnline presence, it would begreatly appreciated. This is a multi faceted sales and marketing tool foryour benefit  .  Aside from the overall goal of creating a unified metalsmarketing plan, we are also trying to prepare a budget to assure that properattention and funds are given Enron metals Global exposure in 2001 .Therefore, if we do not receive your recommendations  well in  advance wewill not be in a position to sponsor them . We have created a conferencelisting which will be circulated next week . Please add to it  if we havemissed any off . and mark onto our list those you think should have  ourattention .For those of you that missed it last week, we have attached another copy ofthe Account Application Form.  The completion of this form for BOTHtraditional and online customers will speed your client's access to tradingwith Enron Metals.The lack of contributions for this review  from  any of you is  ratherdisappointing . We will continue to offer you  items that you may find of use. However the purpose of this  review is also  to incorporate content  fromaround the network of our  global field offices.    I know you are all verybusy  making money for the cause . This  medium is  a useful platform to getyour message over .For those of you not on the circulation lists  see the attached reportsThe Metals Crammer reportThe daily Options reportWhilst not exactly a feature  we thought it might be  a useful exercise inclient relationship damage  limitation  to explain   what happens when acustomer finds he cannot trade  on line .This has begun to occur moreregularly as our volumes and activity increase.Customers are allocated  a credit line for EOL within the system based upontheir  agreements.  This limit   is set daily   as a  default against theclients name . basis the AS400 's  net valuation of the client's position  .The amount of available  variation  credit  on the client's account  on EOLis  set as his  limit f or the next days trading . If the client shouldtrigger this limit  during the next day's trading  the system will reject thetrade and lock out the customer . Not very user friendly   as the customer isnot told why .  London credit (Hamish's team) get a red flag , as of coursedo the traders running the stack managers as they see the trade rejected.The problem now becomes one of frustration for the customer as the systemwill not allow him to liquidate his position either in part or whole .He willhave to pick the phone to do this . Secondly the resetting of any limit inthe system takes 48hrs .  This  is being  worked on but  we must rememberthat Metals are the only futures products on the system and the other OTCproducts on the system  are dealt with differently .  It also serves tohighlight that  clients with small credit lines in the 1 to 200,000 dollarrange are not really suited to use EOL . Security  such as g/tees and cashare taken into account but can be missed  ,but forward profits are as it isnet availability that is  used on the AS400.   This will all improve with theintroduction of  a new bridge  between the Enron  risk system and the AS400in the very near future .In the meantime  it will be up to you to  keep the peace and explain to yourclients .  Get them to keep within their limits . Call them quickly when theyget locked out.Remember, we are here to help your efforts and help create positivecommunication lines between our offices world-wide.

I am not having any problems YET with any of the banks except CSFB- and thats not new.. I have not been able to trade with them for the last year.  I am anticipating problems which is why I am trying to work out a clearing system in the interim.I am sure Ken will do a better job of putting some of these fears to rest.. and the street will be able to assign us a PE in line with other trading companies (8-10) plus some growth component (5) for developing businesses.  And at $20, they reckon we get taken out anyway.. the fact remains that Enron has major franchise value.Good news- Ospraie covered their short at $30 when PGE resiolution came out Thursday and we rallied $4.Other comments from Catequil.. they generally think a lot of the energy sector (E+Ps) are close to bottom.  They also commented that they are likely to buy El Paso at a 10.5 PE soon (even though ours is currently 12.5 and they believe in us) because they just have more access to El Paso Sr Mgmt and understand their biz better.  (Lot of El Paso and Dynegy support out there).  They were never short us.EOG- could see it down to $22 but see $35 based on NAV more realistic.  Like EOG and Chesapeake- well hedged.Also like Philips/ Statoil on the Alaskan gas play as well as the fact that they have 0 mid-east exposure.Like Talisman- only has exposure in Sydan, Nexus- Yemen"

All three models move the main cold trough axis to the GreatLakes area by the last half of the period.  This shift allows for coldPolar/Arctic air to pour into the Midwest and Northeastern states bydays 9 and 10 (as early as day 8 on the American).  The Canadian andEuropean continue more troughing in the southern branch in theSouthwestern states, keeping that area cool, but also forcing continuedridging in the Southern states--from Texas to the Southeast--keepingthem warmer and away from the cold.  The American eliminates thissouthern branch cold air protection early (by day 8), while the Canadianbreaks it down by day 10, implying that even the South would see coldweather at the beginning of the 11-15 day period.  The European appearsto hold out the longest in bringing cold air to the South. In all cases,the West Coast should see some gradual warming by late in the period.All three models also continue a very amplified flow pattern in Canadawith a plentiful supply of strong, cold air.More details, including early information from the ensembles, will be-Matt Rogers"

  "El Paso 1110": [
    "-----Original Message-----Good morning. My name is Nancy Turner, and I have recently joined Kristin Walsh's competitive analysis group where I follow gas industry issues.As you may recall, earlier this summer we informed you that El Paso's line 1110 had been brought down for repair, pigging and OPS review.  Our sources at El Paso and OPS have indicated to us this week that line 1110 is expected to come back online on September 1st.  We understand that the throughput on the entire system at that time should be at least 920 Mmcf/d (same as before it went offline). However, there is a strong possibility that OPS may grant the system permission to return to it's full capacity at 1.1 Bcf/d on September 1st.We are trying to obtain more information on the capacity issue and hope to have this confirmed early next week.  We will keep you posted, but if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at X 51623 or Kristin at X 39510.Nancy TurnerEnron Americas - Houston, TX"

    "on Line 2000Matt,Make sure this is included in your long term forecast.-----Original Message-----Also posted today on El Paso's web site.FYIPress ReleaseEl Paso Announces Binding Open Season for Additional Capacity on Line 2000The expansion capacity will be made available by adding compression to El Paso's Line 2000 from McCamey, Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, Arizona. The expansion capacity will be sold at El Paso's existing maximum California tariff rate, and the fuel charge is estimated to be 5 percent. The projected in-service date of the expansion facilities is mid-2003 subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory, environmental, and right-of-way authorizations.The receipt points on El Paso's system for this capacity will be the Waha and Keystone pools in the Permian Basin area of West Texas. The delivery points will be Southern California Gas Company (SoCal) and PG&E's proposed North Baja Pipeline, El Paso's bi-directional lateral (Line 1903), any future incremental capacity on the SoCal system from Ehrenberg, Arizona into the State of California, and any upstream points on El Paso's south mainline system where capacity exists.``This system expansion will add incremental interstate capacity to California, Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas to meet increasing natural gas demands including the demand for natural gas to generate electricity for the western United States,'' said Patricia A. Shelton, president of El Paso Natural Gas Company.Interested parties can contact their transportation marketing representative or Mr. Jerry W. Strange at (719) 520-4687.CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis release includes forward-looking statements and projections, made in reliance on the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

  "El Paso Update 7/23/011": [
    "-----Original Message-----Sources at OPS indicate that once OPS completes its review of line 1110 and approves it to come back online, there is no formal process to grant El Paso permission to bring the entire system back to full capacity at 1.1 bcf/d. Therefore, once the inspection/repairs are completed by El Paso, the company will seek permission from OPS to resume to full service. OPS would probably grant them approval within a matter of days. The uncertainty still lies in the time it will take to interpret pigging data and for OPS to conduct its review."

While the business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is certain ... we want to inject some humor into the event.  The past year has been eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees.  However, it's not in Enron's corporate fabric to focus on the past.  Instead, we want to look ahead, and even laugh at ourselves.  The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that.We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous \"Home Video\" to be presented at the Management Conference.  The video can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses.  However, there are a few rules to follow.1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long.2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no more than $10,000.  Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive video.  Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424.3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging.  They should adhere to Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.4.)  By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their intention to submit a video.  To avoid duplication, business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address.5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to be submitted to me by Friday, November 9.6.)  Awards will be given for creativity and humor.  The first annual, and soon-to-be-coveted, \"Enny\" will also be awarded for \"Best Overall Video.\"If you have any questions about the \"Home Video\" project, please contact myself or Mary Clark.Terrie Jamesph. 713-853-7727terrie.james@enron.comMary Clarkph. 713-853-7325mary.clark@enron.comGood luck and happy filming!Terrie James"

Soon he quit the millin=g=20business and started stringing transmission lines across the western part o=f=20the state. Before his death in 1930 he had built a utility that lit 56 Kans=as=20communities.=20Kansas City's UtiliCorp United is perhaps the only fourth-generation=20family-controlled electric utility in the country. Today the outfit, once==20called Missouri Public Service, is headed by Lemuel Green's two=20great-grandsons.Richard Green, 46, took over as chief executive in 1985, three years after==20his father's death. At the time Missouri Public Service served 200,000=20customers in two states and had $245 million in revenues. Richard's brother==20Robert, now 39, joined him three years later.=20Standing pat was not an option. Deregulation was in the air, and the rules==20were changing. The brothers remade the company. They spent $4 billion buyin=g=20utilities in other parts of the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.=20UtiliCorp now serves 4 million customers in seven states and four countries=.=20More important, they veered off into other parts of the energy business. In==201986 they acquired gas properties from Peoples Natural Gas of Omaha and got=a=20two-person gas-trading operation as part of the deal. That little trading==20operation, now a subsidiary called Aquila, turned into something almost as==20valuable as all the rest of the company, with its 4,500 megawatts of power==20generated in some 22 power plants around the country.=20\"My brother and I received strong advice that we would never be able to be==20competitive in this business,\" says Bob Green. Oh, yeah? Aquila has 1,100==20employees and competes with the likes of Duke, Dynegy and Enron. According =to=20Natural Gas Week, Aquila was the fourth-largest power-and-gas marketer in t=he=20country last year. Aquila trades a host of other products as well-everythin=g=20from weather-condition hedges to bandwidth.=20solution, until now, has been what brother Bob calls \"our 'asset lite'=20strategy. We want to control the capacity, not own it.\" So Aquila may provi=de=20the gas to power a so-called merchant plant, one that produces electricity =to=20sell in the market, in return for a claim on its production. But so far=20Aquila has not been a big player in the most profitable parts of the=20business-taking on big risk in larger transactions, the way Enron and Dyneg=y=20do.=20What to do? In mid-December UtiliCorp announced that it would offer 19.9% o=f=20Aquila to the public, raising capital while creating a market value for its==20trading operation, just as competitors Constellation Energy and Southern=20Company are doing. The hope is that the new entity will garner a multiple o=f=2020 to 45 times earnings. Then, if all were to go as planned, UtiliCorp woul=d=20spin off the rest of the operation in a tax-free distribution.=20The timing looks good. Aquila has no material exposure in the California=20market. Furthermore, the volatility in that market has been a bonanza for==20many firms that trade power, including Aquila. Its trading subsidiary is th=e=20reason UtiliCorp's earnings were up 28% last year, to $206 million, on $29==20billion in sales. UtiliCorp's shares doubled in the past year to $30.=20But will the California crisis nonetheless poison the market for an Aquila==20stock offering? It might. And UtiliCorp cannot afford to hold its breath in==20the capital markets forever. Even with its \"asset-lite\" strategy, the compa=ny=20is far more leveraged than most utilities, with debt at 56% of capital,=20versus the 50% norm for electric utilities. The offering is supposed to rai=se=20$425 million or so that could be used to pay down a bit of the parent's $2.=9=20billion in debt.=20If Bob Green is walking a financial tightrope, you could never tell it by==20talking to him. \"We see this company as our heritage,\" he says confidently.==20This despite the fact that after seven equity offerings the family's share =of=20UtiliCorp is now 4%, down from 15% when Richard took over.=20Might the Greens lose their heirloom in a takeover battle? They might, but==20they might come out ahead anyway. Look at the family history. Lemuel sold==20some of his utility assets for $6.6 million in 1927 and diversified into=20California orange groves. The assets were resold to Samuel Insull, the=20midwestern electricity magnate who came to a bad end when his pyramid of=20holding companies collapsed during the Depression.

No Proble=mBy Chip CumminsStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal03/08/2001The Wall Street JournalA1(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Two years ago, Bradley Hoggatt was heading for an academic career in=20meteorology, intent on discovering more about how hurricanes form. But just==20before he started working on a doctorate, a very different opportunity blew==20in.=20Now Mr. Hoggatt forecasts weather for a floor full of M.B.A.s who trade=20billions of dollars in weather-sensitive energy commodities such as natural==20gas and electricity for Aquila Inc., the trading subsidiary of a big Midwes=t=20utility.With no business background himself, Mr. Hoggatt is also trading complex=20financial contracts based on his predictions. \"I'm putting my money where m=y=20mouth is,\" says the tall, square-shouldered 28-year-old.=20Weathermen and women have become a hot commodity in the exploding=20energy-trading business. While off-target forecasts on television may=20frustrate parents and schools and embarrass politicians, as they did this==20week on the East Coast, they can lose bundles for electricity and natural-g=as=20traders. So as trading has boomed, so has demand for trained meteorologists=,=20a profession that traditionally hasn't paid all that well and is often the==20butt of jokes.=20From Wall Street to Houston's Louisiana Street, where many energy companies==20have set up shop, recent graduates are earning twice what they would earn a=t=20the National Weather Service or in academia. \"The appetite for weather is==20insatiable,\" says James L. Gooding, director of meteorology at Duke Energy==20Corp. A former NASA scientist, Dr. Gooding will be adding a fourth forecast=er=20to his Houston team in the next year.=20Enron Corp., an energy-trading giant based in Houston, has more than double=d=20its staff of weather forecasters to nine in the past three years, plucking==20talent from places like the Weather Channel. Williams Cos., a Tulsa, Okla.,==20competitor, is endowing university fellowships to lure meteorology students=.=20And since 1999, Aquila, which is owned by UtiliCorp United Inc., of Kansas==20City, Mo., has hired two other meteorologists from Mr. Hoggatt's alma mater=,=20the University of Wisconsin, plus another scientist with a Ph.D. in=20climatology.=20That hiring paid off a bit during this week's winter storm in the Northeast=.=20While many on the East Coast were getting miscues from TV weathermen on a==20pending, possibly historic blizzard that fizzled in New York and other=20cities, traders at Aquila simply looked to Mr. Hoggatt.=20Last Friday, Scott Macrorie, an electricity trader for the Mid-Atlantic=20region at Aquila, stopped by to see how the storm was progressing. Mr.=20Hoggatt's team told him temperatures in his region of interest would be low=er=20because of the storm, though the snowfall forecast on TV seemed a little=20high. Sure enough, temperatures fell and snowfall in many cities was less==20than predicted, lifting electricity prices and making Mr. Macrorie a profit==20that he says was in the tens of thousands of dollars.=20About 500 university students in the U.S. graduate each year with bachelor'=s=20degrees in meteorology, according to the American Meteorological Society. A=n=20additional 300 or so graduate with masters degrees or doctorates. Until jus=t=20=20those who had the blow-dried look, back-office jobs with the government or =a=20handful of private consultants for those who didn't. Research was an option=.=20And some airlines and utilities kept a few meteorologists on staff to help==20position airplanes or power-line repair trucks during storms.=20Now, deep-pocketed trading companies are offering many meteorologists with==20graduate degrees salaries ranging from $60,000 to $90,000. Performance and==20trading bonuses can double or even triple the figure. That compares with th=e=20roughly $33,000 the National Weather Service pays a junior forecaster with =a=20graduate degree.=20\"It's a bit unusual for meteorologists to have the prospect of lucrative=20employment after graduation,\" says John Nielsen-Gammon, a professor of=20atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University. \"This is a bit of a switch.\"==20So far, there has been no dearth of meteorological talent available, partly==20because the National Weather Service wrapped up a big expansion project in==20the mid-1990s and slowed hiring. It hires only to replace people who leave,==20about 30 to 50 meteorologists a year.=20And the high-pressure world of billion-dollar commodity bets isn't for=20everyone.

Spencer Abraham, thenew energy secretary, said Californians simply goofed, setting up a''dysfunctional'' system. It is the way California deregulated, notderegulation itself, that should take the blame, they say.Yet some economists argue that California's troubles should inform the debateabout whether -- not just how -- to deregulate. Among them is Alfred E. Kahn,the Cornell University economist who helped oversee the creation of freemarkets in the rail, trucking and airline industries.''I am worried about the uniqueness of electricity markets,'' Mr. Kahn said.He is still studying whether the design flaws in California's market explainthe whole problem. But he is sounding a note of skepticism.''I've always been uncertain about eliminating vertical integration,'' hesaid, referring to the old ways of allowing a single, heavily regulated powercompany to produce, transmit and distribute electricity. ''It may be oneindustry in which it works reasonably well.''Mr. Kahn's comments might sound a little heretical. When this former Carteradministration official was pushing deregulation, it was still a novel andpolitically risky concept. Today, getting government out of most businessesis part of the Washington economic canon.Moreover, few people believe that California, the first state to overhaul itselectricity sector from top to bottom, has proved a good laboratory. Tosatisfy interest groups, the markets were designed in an awkward way, whichsoured some deregulation experts on California before the first electron wenton the auction block.on daily spot markets, rather than arranging long-term contracts that mighthave allowed them to hedge risk. Consumer prices were also fixed, making itimpossible for utilities to pass on higher wholesale costs.Paul L. Joskow, an expert on electricity markets at the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology and a former student of Mr. Kahn's, remains hopefulthat the kinks can be ironed out.In New England and the the Middle Atlantic states, as well in as Britain,Chile and Argentina, all places that have restructured electricity markets,regulators have had to adjust market rules to correct flaws. They have foundways to check the tendency of power sellers to exploit infant markets andcharge high prices, Mr. Joskow said.Regulators have also had to establish new markets that, through pricesignals, encourage power companies to build enough generating capacity sothat they have reserves for peak hours. During peak hours, shortages andprice spikes can substantially raise average prices.''If they can do it in Britain, Chile and Argentina, then I think we can doit here,'' Mr. Joskow said.Still, he warns that proper regulation requires tough political choices.Allowing high prices to pass through to consumers is one. Making sureNimbyism does not prevent the construction of power plants is another.''The political system must rise to the task,'' Mr. Joskow said, or the ''oldway might be the best we can do.''Mr. Kahn knows a bit about the old way. In the mid-1970's, he headed the NewYork Public Service Commission, which oversaw electricity and other regulatedindustries. The drawbacks were legendary. Local utilities had an endemictendency to overestimate demand to justify new power plants, for whichconsumers paid through steady rate increases. Nearly everyone assumed thatcompetition would slash prices.But though free markets do a better job managing rail, phone and airlineprices, they have yet to match regulators' ability to juggle the complexitiesof electricity, Mr. Kahn said.Regulators tended to apply heavy political pressure on utilities to keepprices as low as possible and profit margins steady but thin. The verticalintegration of electricity monopolies may have also had advantages, Mr. Kahnsaid. Engineers coordinated power plants and transmission lines in idealways. Planners who saw the need for new plants helped find a place for themto be built. ''The players all depended on one another,'' he said.California has probably not derailed deregulation efforts. But it has madepeople wonder anew whether market forces work for kilowatts as they do forwidgets.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.NEWSEnron's Chief Denies Role as Energy Villain / Critics regard Kenneth Lay asderegulation opportunistDavid LazarusChronicle Staff Writer03/04/2001The San Francisco ChronicleFINALA1(Copyright 2001)Kenneth Lay is one of the energy \"pirates\" accused by California's governorof fleecing consumers. As chairman of Enron Corp., the world's largest energytrader, Lay is arguably the biggest, baddest buccaneer of them all.But that's not how he wants to be seen. And he certainly doesn't like takingknocks from Gov. Gray Davis for having contributed to California's energymess.\"It's very unfair,\" Lay said, his brown eyes taking on a puppy- dog quality.\"He's trying to vilify us. But we didn't make the rules in California. We hadnothing to do with creating the problem.\"He gazed out from his plush, 50th-floor office. Houston's downtownskyscrapers jutted like sharp teeth against the overcast sky.\"Everyone played by the rules,\" Lay said. \"Now our reputations are beingmaligned.\"In a sense, he's right. The ultimate blame does rest with Californiapolicymakers for deregulating the state's electricity market in such aham-fisted way that power giants like Enron cleaned up by exploitingloopholes in the system.But Enron was no innocent bystander during the restructuring process.\"Enron and Ken Lay were one of the major players behind the push forderegulation in California,\" said Janee Briesemeister, senior policy analystin the Austin office of Consumers Union. \"A lot of what's happening inCalifornia was their idea.\"Those familiar with the state's deregulation efforts said Enron wasespecially eager to ensure that a newly created Power Exchange, wherewholesale power would be bought and sold, was separate from the IndependentSystem Operator, which would oversee the electricity grid.\"This fragmented the wholesale market, making it harder to monitor,\" saidJohn Rozsa, an aide to state Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, widely regarded asthe godfather of California's bungled deregulation measures.\"Enron isn't in the business of making markets work,\" Rozsa said. \"They're inthe business of making a buck.\"In an ironic twist, however, Enron now could play a pivotal role in helpingthe state remedy past errors and find its energy footing. The company hasthat much clout.SEEKING LAY'S BLESSINGThus, as the governor pushes ahead with a scheme to purchase the transmissionlines of California's cash-strapped utilities, he didn't hesitate to callrecently seeking Lay's personal blessing for the plan.This must have been a sweet moment for the man who just weeks earlier hadbeen castigated by Davis in the governor's State of the State speech.\"I told him we couldn't support it,\" Lay said, a hint of a smile playingacross his lips. \"It will lead to an even less efficient transmission gridand, longer term, it could make things worse.\"Why would Davis swallow his pride and court favor with Enron's big cheese?power-line sale fly, and, many believe, there's no faster way to reach thenew president than via the Houston office of his leading corporate patron.Lay, 58, and his company have donated more than $500,000 to Bush's variouspolitical campaigns in recent years, and he placed Enron's private jet atBush's disposal during the presidential race.So great is Lay's influence with the president that some insist he is nowserving effectively as shadow energy secretary, shaping U.S. energy policy ashe sees fit.\"There's a long history of Enron pulling the levers of its politicalrelationships to get what it wants,\" said Craig McDonald, director of Texansfor Public Justice, a watchdog group. \"What Ken Lay thinks energy policyshould be isn't very different from what George Bush and Dick Cheney think itshould be.\"ANOTHER VIEWPOINTLay, of course, sees things differently. At the mere mention of his closerapport with the president, his eyes glazed over and he mechanically recitedthe words he has repeated numerous times in recent months.\"I have known the president and his family for many years,\" Lay said. \"I'vebeen a strong supporter of his. I believe in him and I believe in hispolicies.\"He insisted that reports of his having sway over Bush on energy matters are\"grossly exaggerated.\"Still, it is striking that Bush's quick decision after taking office to limitfederal assistance in solving California's energy woes virtually mirroredLay's own thoughts on the situation. So, too, with the administration'shands-off approach to resolving the crisis.Whatever else, California's power woes have been very kind to Enron's bottomline. The company's revenues more than doubled to $101 billion last year.They haven't hurt Lay, either. According to company records, his pay packagemore than tripled last year to $18.3 million.Lay and other Enron officials steadfastly refuse to break out the company'sCalifornia earnings from other worldwide business activities. But Layconceded that Enron's profit from California energy deals last year was \"notinconsequential.\"\"We benefit from the volatility,\" he said.CAPTIVE MARKETPLACEThat's putting it mildly. It could be said that California's energy mess wastailor-made for Enron, which is almost uniquely positioned to prosper from acaptive marketplace in which electricity and natural gas prices aresimultaneously soaring skyward.To understand why that is, one must look closely at Enron's complex businessmodel. The company is much more than just a middleman in brokering energydeals.Lay, with a doctorate in economics and a background as a federal energyregulator, set about completely reinventing Enron in 1985 after taking overwhat was then an unexceptional natural-gas pipeline operator.As he saw it, the real action was not in distribution or generation ofenergy, but in transacting lightning-fast deals wherever electricity or gasis needed -- treating energy like a tradable commodity for the first time.Enron is now the leader in this fast-growing field, and uses that advantageto consolidate its position as the market-maker of choice for energy buyersand sellers throughout the country.It also exploits its size and trading sophistication to structure unusuallycreative deals. For example, if electricity prices are down but natural gasprices up, Enron might cut a deal to meet a utility's power needs in returnfor taking possession of the gas required to run the utility's plants.Enron could then turn around and sell that gas elsewhere, using part of theproceeds to purchase low-priced electricity from another provider, which itships back to the original utility.\"We do best in competitive markets,\" Lay said. \"These are sustainablemarkets.\"TRADING FRENZYEnron's trading floors buzz all day long with frantic activity as mostlyyoung, mostly male employees scan banks of flat-panel displays in search ofthe best deals. Rock music blares from speakers, giving the scene an almostfrat-party atmosphere.The company's trading volume skyrocketed last year with the advent of anInternet-based bidding system, which logged 548,000 trades valued at $336billion, making Enron by far the world's single biggest e-commerce entity.Kevin Presto, who oversees Enron's East Coast power trades, called up theCalifornia electricity market on his computer. With a few quick mouse clicks,he showed that Enron at that moment was buying power in the Golden State at$250 per megawatt hour and selling it at $275.\"Some days we're at $250, some days $300 and some days $500,\" Presto saidover the steady thump-thump of the trading floor's rock 'n' roll soundtrack.\"There's truly a problem out there.\"market is broken and Enron would prefer it if things just settled down. AsLay himself put it, \"The worst thing for us is a dysfunctional marketplace.\"In reality, California's dysfunctional marketplace means Enron isn't justmaking piles of money, it's seeing profits both coming and going.LOTS OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIAThe company's energy services division, which handles the complete energyneeds of large institutions, counts among its clients the University ofCalifornia and California State school systems, Oakland's Clorox Co., andeven the San Francisco Giants and Pac Bell Park.Enron purchases electricity on behalf of these clients from Pacific Gas andElectric Co., which by law must keep its rates frozen below current marketvalues. At the same time, Enron sells power to PG&E at sky-high wholesalelevels.In other words, Enron is buying back its own electricity from PG&E for just afraction of the price it charges the utility.\"These guys are the pariahs of the power system,\" said Nettie Hoge, executivedirector of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. \"Why do we needmiddlemen? They don't do anything except mark up the cost.\"To be fair, energy marketers such as Enron can help stabilize an efficientmarketplace by promoting increased competition between buyers and sellers.This has proven the case in Pennsylvania, where Enron actively trades amongabout 200 market participants.But in an inefficient market such as California, a company like Enron caneasily exacerbate things by exploiting loopholes in the state's ill-conceivedregulatory framework.Sylvester Turner, a Houston lawmaker who serves as vice chairman of the statecommittee that oversees Texas utilities, said he can't blame Enron and otherpower companies for pursuing profits in California.\"California set up some bad rules, and these companies played by the rulesCalifornia set up,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, they will behave toenhance their bottom lines.\"But as Texas proceeds toward deregulation of its own electricity market nextyear, Turner said he has learned from California's experience -- and istaking steps to prevent Texas' power giants from shaking down localconsumers.LESSONS FROM GOLDEN STATEHe has written a bill intended to give the Texas Public Utility Commissionmore authority in cracking down on market abuses. The power companies arefighting the legislation as hard as they can.Not least among Turner's worries is that Texas will see what Californiaby leading providers until surging demand had pushed prices higher.\"I have that concern,\" he said. \"I don't necessarily take these companies attheir word.\"For his part, Lay insists that Enron has never deliberately manipulatedelectricity prices.\"I don't know of any of that,\" he said. \"It's so easy to conjure upconspiracy theories.\"As a sign of Enron's commitment to solving California's energy troubles, Laysaid he supported Davis when the state began negotiating long-term powercontracts on behalf of utilities.So how many contracts has Enron signed?Suddenly, the hurt, puppyish expression vanished from Lay's face, and aharder, more steely look glinted from his eyes.\"None,\" he said. \"We won't be signing until we're certain about recoveringour costs.\"Consider this a shot across California's bow.creating the (energy) problem.\"Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Yes, his business has profited handsomely fromCalifornia's energy crisis, but Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay says heshouldn't be a scapegoat in California's energy crisis.That hasn't swayed Gov. Gray Davis, who has skewered energy companies such asHouston-based Enron for selling expensive power to California.\"Never again can we allow out-of-state profiteers to hold Californianshostage,\" Davis warned in his State of the State address.More recently, however, Davis called Lay to discuss negotiations as the statelooks to buy power transmission lines from troubled utilities.\"I told him we couldn't support it,\" Lay told the San Francisco Chronicle inan interview at his Houston office. \"It will lead to an even less efficienttransmission grid and, longer term, it could make things worse.\"Lay is not just any private-sector energy czar - Enron Corp. is the world'slargest energy trader and Lay is a close friend of President George Bush. Layand his corporation have donated more than $500,000 to Bush's variouspolitical campaigns in recent years and he offered Bush use of Enron'sprivate jet during the presidential race.But Lay said it's economics, not politics, that matter in California's energycrisis. And he thinks it unfair that Davis has blamed out-of-state energybrokers for the protracted problems.\"We didn't make the rules in California,\" Lay said. \"We had nothing to dowith creating the problem.\"The problem, many analysts agree, began with the state's deregulation of thepower industry in 1996. Enron encouraged deregulation, and the state'sensuing power crisis has been lucrative for the corporation.Enron's stock jumped 86 percent in 2000 and its revenues more than doubled to$101 billion.

Pro Player was part of underwear-maker Fruit of the Loom.The home of the Anaheim Angels could be in the market for a new name ifEdison International, parent of electric utility Southern California Edison,runs out of juice.Of course, these companies were not in trouble when they promised to pay tensor hundreds of millions of dollars to have their names plastered on aballpark or arena.In fact, many were at their peak.they own stock puts its name up among the floodlights?Brian Pears, head of equity trading with Wells Capital Management, wonders ifcompanies are susceptible to some weird strain of the \"Sports Illustratedcurse.\" It seems as if any athlete who is pictured on the cover of SImagazine invariably loses his next game or pulls a groin muscle.Executive Officer Jeff Bezos was named Time magazine's 1999 person of theyear just before his company's stock price tanked.Don Hinchey, who advises buyers and sellers in naming-rights deals, doesn'tthink the curse holds true in stadium and arena deals.\"You can make a case that a company is doing well when it acquires a namingrights sponsorship, but you can't necessarily say it corresponds with a peakin its business,\" says Hinchey, director of creative services for the BonhamGroup in Denver.TRACKING NAMING FIRMSTo find out if Hinchey is right, I tracked the stock market performance ofpublicly held companies since they bought naming rights to 47 big-leaguesports venues in North America.I excluded facilities named after subsidiaries of larger companies, includingMiller Park in Milwaukee (Miller Brewing is part of Philip Morris) and PacBell Park in San Francisco (Pacific Bell is owned by SBC Communications,which is putting its own name on an arena in San Antonio).I used the announcement date as a starting point because stadium naming dealsare, after all, marketing endeavors. The announcement of a deal generatestons of publicity, which is considered positive, even if the publicity isnegative and even if the stadium won't open for several years.Then I compared each company's stock market performance with the Standard &Poor's 500 index during the same period.are trading at a higher stock price today than when the deals were announced,according to data from FactSet Research Systems. (Two companies each boughttwo names and were counted twice.)But -- and this is a big but -- only 13 of them beat the S&P 500 during theperiod since their respective deals were announced.So buying a stadium name might not be a curse, but it's no guarantee thecompany will beat the market.WINNERS, LOSERSThe companies that have done best since buying a name come from a widevariety of industries.The biggest winner is Qualcomm, a wireless telecommunications company.Although its stock is down 65 percent from its peak, it's still up 746percent since it agreed to slap its name on a San Diego stadium.The next-biggest winners include Target (discount stores), Ericsson (telecomequipment), Coors (beer), Fleet Financial (banking), Pepsi (soft drinks) andEnron (energy).The biggest losers are TWA, PSINet (Internet service provider), CMGI(Internet incubator), Savvis Communications (telecom services) and NetworkAssociates (network security software).Network Associates' stock peaked about three months after it bought namingrights to the Oakland Coliseum in September 1998. Since then, it has suffereda string of setbacks. After the Securities and Exchange Commission questionedits accounting practices, it restated its financial results for 1997 and1998. Its CEO resigned in December.Network Associates is paying slightly more than $1 million per year for thecoliseum name. It can get out of its 10-year deal after five years.The company \"has been paying us,\" says Deena McClain, general counsel withthe Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority. \"We haven't had anydiscussions with them\" about changing the contract.Most naming-rights contracts have \"out clauses that allow the parties toextricate themselves if they want, can or need to in the event of financialdifficulties or if a team moves,\" says Hinchey.Although nobody likes to be associated with a loser, stadium owners maybenefit if a troubled company cuts out of a deal early.That's because stadium name prices have skyrocketed since the mid- 1990s,when $1 million a year -- give or take -- was average.In 1999, FedEx agreed to pay $205 million over 27 years to be named home ofthe Washington Redskins.In 2000, CMGI agreed to pay $114 million over 15 years to have its name onthe new home of the New England Patriots. It's questionable what kind ofshape CMGI will be in when the stadium opens next year.The \"10-gallon hat of naming rights deals,\" says Hinchey, is in Houston,where Reliant Energy will pay $300 million over 32 years to name theAstrodome and a new football stadium after itself.Some customers of Reliant's utility subsidiary were outraged when the dealwas announced because the company was also raising electricity rates.Some shareholders also get perturbed when their company spends money on astadium instead of a new plant or stock dividends.But Jim Grinstead, editor of Revenues from Sports Venues, says, \"you have tolook at the (stadium) purchase in light of total marketing budget. It soundslike big money, but frequently it's over 20 to 30 years. If you take outthings the company might buy anyway, like tickets and luxury suites, it'ssmall potatoes.\"WHAT A DEAL IS WORTHThe main benefit of a stadium deal is the exposure a company gets when a gameis broadcast on TV or radio or mentioned in print.\"This is the biggest bang for your buck in terms of branding,\" says JenniferKeavney, a Network Associates vice president who negotiated the stadium deal.She says the cost of her deal, about $1 million a year, \"won't even buy you aSuper Bowl ad. It will buy five commercials on a nationally televisedfootball game, maybe.\"The Coliseum, perched beside Interstate 880, also acts like a giant billboardfor the company, which frequently gets mentioned in traffic reports.Hinchey says most naming deals also include tickets and luxury boxes; on-siteexposure through signage and kiosks; premium nights when the sponsor mightoffer samples at the park; and inclusion in programs, tickets and flyers.Most companies that strike stadium deals want to become a household namebecause they sell consumer products or services.But not always.3Com sold nothing but corporate networking gear when it bought the name toCandlestick Park in San Francisco in 1995.\"It was a good move for them,\" says Jim Grinstead, editor of Revenues fromSports Venues. \"They got the employees they were looking for, the visibilitythey were looking for. At the time, they were a player in a crowded field,and they wanted to look like a fun place to work.\"Last April, 3Com extended its original 4-year contract for two more years.The biggest risk companies run is that the team that plays in their facilitywill be a loser.\"Companies invest in an entity that can enhance their brand, their sales andhospitality efforts. Certainly that loses its luster if the team is notperforming well,\" Hinchey says. \"But corporations realize the team's successon the field fluctuates. It could be a champion one year, next year in thedumps.\"The same can be said about the corporate sponsors, which is something stadiumowners -- be they taxpayers or business tycoons -- must realize when theysell a name.Network Associates Coliseum last year. / Frederic Larson/The Chronicle 2000Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

In the meantime, \"I have had to avoid being involved in matters that specifically and materially affect my specific holdings,\" Mr. Rove said.Mr. Rove said he filed his financial disclosure reports Dec. 30 and was later informed by the Office of Government Ethics that he should sell all of his stock holdings to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest.But the government ethics office, which couldn't be reached for comment yesterday, has yet to officially grant Mr. Rove a certificate of divestiture, which would allow him to roll his proceeds into diversified accounts, according to White House spokeswoman Anne Womack. It appears that Mr. Rove has lost tens of thousands of dollars as a result of the delay because most of his stocks have lost value since the beginning of the year.Mr. Rove insisted that he has been careful to avoid any discussions that directly affect companies he is invested in, as federal conflict-of-interest laws require. But that can't be easy for Mr. Rove, widely regarded as one of the most powerful and influential figures in the White House. Mr. Rove serves as the president's top political adviser and runs the administration's long-term strategy team. He is also the president's top liaison to outside groups, including corporations.\"He's involved in virtually every decision that is made here,\" says a White House aide. It is unclear how many times, if ever, Mr. Rove recused himself from discussion inside the White House.President Bush, already under fire from Democrats for his administration's close ties to industry, is likely to draw more scrutiny as a result of the new disclosures of financial links between top White House officials and major U.S. corporations, especially energy firms.The White House disclosed the personal finances of Mr. Rove and several other top administration officials at the behest of the media. It appears that as a result of an administrative backlog, Mr. Rove is the only member of the senior staff who hasn't been given the green light to sell his stock, according to a White House aide.The reports show that Mr. Rove was one of several White House officials with a financial connection, past or present, with Enron and other energy companies. Larry Lindsey, the president's top economic adviser who helped draft the energy plan, received $50,000 from Enron in 2000 for consulting work he did for the company, the documents show.Lewis Libby, chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, who was chairman of the White House task force that wrote the energy plan, recently sold tens of thousands of dollars of stock in Enron and other energy companies, including Texaco Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chesapeake Energy Corp. It is unclear when the transaction went through.Clay Johnson, director of presidential personnel, reported holding between $100,000 and $250,000 in El Paso Energy Partners LP. And National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice had $250,000 to $500,000 worth of Chevron Corp. stock and was paid $60,000 last year for her work as a director at the company. Mr. Rove disclosed smaller holdings in BP PLC and Royal Dutch/Shell Group.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Perhaps the Buddha does not say that, but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have said it, maybe, had he not been saying the other things.Our enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger. They can be consumed with greed and contempt, their very breath can be toxic, and yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths.Take Enron, the energy company, or Chevron, another energy company, or El Paso Natural Gas, yet another energy company. These organizations are the minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant. Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and meekly hand over tribute.And yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray that their executives land in jail, but we thank them. They have shown us the nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth.We have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great dripping gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we understand that energy companies could create \"shortages\" whenever they wanted merely by closing plants for \"maintenance\"? You bet we did. And did we confuse the energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to repeal the laws of nature? We did not.But it was more convenient to forget those things, and so we did. We have busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is everywhere crumbling, and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying bureaucrats with taxes, but the bureaucrats are inadequate, so now the spirit of volunteerism is much praised.Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but don't.AND SOMEHOW, EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one, we forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that credit card debt is good clean fun, we decided to waste a lot of money using energy we didn't need.I'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about washing machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances plugged in but never used.We pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why Dick Cheney believes he can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has.Why did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional compensation for its executives, who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it! They will get away with it! You watch!I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are active villains, and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone in a corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up with any extra money.We are the fools. If we understand our foolishness, we begin to be wise.

And few industries are more prone to boom and bust than energy.\"The energy industry is suffering its worst downturn since the supply glut of the 1990s, as dozens of big new power plants come on line, and the just-completed Alaskan gas pipeline sends natural gas prices to their lowest levels in six years.\"The one bright spot for Texas generators is California, where consumers are locked into long-term contracts for wholesale electricity that the state signed at the peak of its blackouts in the summer of 2001.\"Sacramento lawmakers have appealed to President Daschle to help get the state off the hook, arguing that California will never claw its way out of its economic slump if businesses continue to flee to states where energy is cheap.\"But top Enron lobbyist Gray Davis, a former governor of California, warned Daschle that suppliers would have little choice but to go to court to enforce the contracts the state signed.\"Washington and Sacramento are agog with the energy crisis and bursting at the seams with plans to fix it. But the one thing no one - - even environmentalists -- suggests is letting high energy prices discourage energy consumption or encourage new supplies.\"To economists, letting the price rise is the solution,\" said Paul Portney, president of Resources for the Future, a Washington think tank. \"To elected representatives, having the price go up is the problem.\"Political memories tend to be selective and short. But it was the energy glut of the 1990s that contributed to California's blackouts, $3 gasoline and $400-a-month heating bills. Likewise, high prices are now laying the seeds of their own destruction.As a story in the New York Times noted, an energy investment boom \"promises a cyclical increase in supplies that is expected to stabilize or reduce prices in coming months, many industry executives and private analysts say.\"Through much of the 1990s, there was a glut of energy. Fuel of all kinds was really cheap.How cheap? Adjusted for inflation, as cheap as in 1949, economists calculate.Energy is the oxygen of the economy, and rock-bottom prices contributed to the long economic boom. But low prices also caused energy production to slump and consumption to soar.People ditched their economy cars for SUVs. Houses got bigger, ceilings got higher and kitchens sprouted industrial stoves with enough BTUs to melt aluminum. Stores, offices and homes turned into summertime refrigerators.Low prices discouraged energy development.\"Oil was so cheap for so long, that people were selling their refineries,\" Portney said. \"You had virtually no exploration for new natural gas when prices were at $2 a BTU.\"As demand soared and supply fell, prices rose. Profits have grown so robust that green fuels, such as biomass and wind, are becoming economically viable. The oil industry is booming. Refineries are expanding. The long-delayed construction of a natural gas pipeline from Alaska now looks likely. So many power plants are under construction that the market may be flooded with as much as 200,000 new megawatts by 2004.Investments in energy efficiency -- from new-age superconducting transmission wires to better light bulbs -- are suddenly looking attractive for the first time in decades.\"High prices will dampen demand, high prices will encourage supply, and will encourage people to make better use of what they've got,\" said Robert Ebel, director of energy for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"So we're starting on the down slope. We're not very far down. When prices start to decline, I can't say how far they will go. But they will decline, because that's just the law of supply and demand. Prices decline, demand starts to creep up again, there's less incentive to add to supply, and here we go again.\"Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Basu, chief economist for South East Asia at Credit Suisse First Boston, Singapore.Foreign investment has been pouring in - portfolio flows at $2.2 billion so far in 2001 are at record levels and compare with $1.56 billion for the whole of 2000 - and foreign exchange reserves are strong at $42.8 billion.Interest rates and yields have also dropped, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) adopting an aggressive easing stance this year to prop the slowing economy, and inflation is benign.\"The hardest initial steps are being taken and there is still a lot of inertia, but soon there will be a willing audience and reforms can progress faster,\" CARE's Nagarajan said.But critics said the changes were still very superficial and structural reforms that would spur long-term growth and demand were lacking.\"What the rating agencies have emphasised is fiscal consolidation, which means better revenue streams, efficient expenses, user charges for public utilities...we promised these three years back and haven't moved very far on those,\" said Saumitra Chaudhari, economist with local rating agency ICRA Ltd.\"We still do not have a securities bill, mature debt market and our banks have not cleaned up,\".Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.By Sriram Ramakrishnan06/04/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - Lenders to Enron Corp's troubled Dabhol Power Company begin a two-day meeting in Singapore on Tuesday to try and settle differences over continued support to a controversial $2.9 billion power project in India.Representatives of some of the world's largest banks like Citibank , ABN AMRO , and Bank of America, will be at the meeting. Indian lenders like the Industrial Development Bank of India , State Bank of India and ICICI will also participate.Market analysts speculate that the meeting will attempt to forge a joint stand on supporting the project which now produces 740 MW of power and is slated to increase it to 2,184 MW shortly in its second phase.But it comes against a backdrop of rising tension between Dabhol and the Indian state utility, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), which is the sole buyer of Dabhol's electricity.Indian lenders, who have lent the bulk of the funds to the plant, want to continue supporting the project.But they are being opposed by offshore lenders who want to withdraw their loans. Loans of around $638 million of the offshore lenders are covered by guarantees provided by Indian institutions.The Indian lenders, fearing for their profitability if the foreign banks pull the plug, plan to oppose any such move.But they have been forced on the backfoot by MSEB's decision last week to stop buying power from Dabhol and terminate its 1995 contract with the company under which it agreed to lift the entire output.The MSEB has complained that Dabhol produces costly power while Dabhol has blamed MSEB for defaulting on payments worth $48 million.Last month, Dabhol issued a preliminary notice to terminate its contract to sell power. It has also filed for arbitration in London. This provoked MSEB to haul Dabhol before a local regulatory body, the Maharashtra State Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), which issued a temporary order staying the arbitration proceedings.The dispute has already affected India's image among foreign investors.Last week, global rating agency Moody's expressed concern over slippage in the Indian government's reform programme and cited the Enron's dispute as an example that the country may be losing credibility with foreign investors.\"The dispute indicates that India's government may not be willing to live up to its contractual obligations. As a consequence, this would further deter foreign direct investment from coming into the country,\" Moody's said.India's federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu tried to dispel those fears in an interview with Reuters on Sunday.\"India is always in favour of making sure that international contracts are respected,\" he said. \"There is no need for concern.\" ($1 = 47 Indian rupees).Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.By Clarence Fernandez06/04/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - India's reforms of its sputtering power sector have entered a new phase, with plans afoot to free up private supply, overhaul debt-ridden state utilities and recraft tariffs, Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told Reuters.With investors' fears fanned by a squabble between U.S. energy giant Enron Corp and a local utility, Prabhu said in an interview late on Sunday that India is standing behind international contracts.\"Sanctity of contracts has to be kept,\" Prabhu said.The row began late last year when the utility in western Maharashtra state defaulted on payments of $48 million to Dabhol Power Company, 65 percent owned by Enron. The 2,184 MW power project is India's largest foreign investment, at $2.9 billion.Prabhu has vowed to take Indian reforms in a new direction.\"Absolutely,\" he said in reply to a question whether India's reforms have entered a different phase. The Power Ministry will now also focus on power distribution, he added, besides its early preoccupation with generation needs.\"In India unfortunately for the last 10 years...reforms policy was skewed in favour of generation,\" he said. \"We never really realised that distribution is the more important part of the process.\"Prabhu added, \"We have now decided we will make enough structural changes in distribution so that at the end of distribution enough investment is made.\"CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTA chartered accountant, Prabhu hails from the verdant regions of India's western coastal strand, and chaired a co-operative bank that was one of the country's largest, in terms of deposits, before his foray into politics.An errant lock of hair straying across his forehead, Prabhu eschews the Indian politician's traditional uniform of starched white handspun cotton for the shirtsleeves and trousers preferred by the professionals who have entered government, and whom local media call \"technocrats\".Prabhu said India has decided to allow private producers to sell power direct to consumers, lifting curbs that have hobbled the country's decade-old reform effort.He said the question of power affordability had spurred him to ask India's states to permit third-party sales of power, which analysts have called a stumbling-block for foreign investment.\"They cannot force a generator to sell power only to the SEBs, and that's a major change we are trying to make,\" Prabhu said, referring to the states.SEBs or state electricity boards are owned by the state governments, and supply power to most of India.India estimates that 100,000 MW of fresh capacity will have to be installed over the next 12 years to meet its power needs. Most of the $200 billion in funds that will be required will have to come from foreign private investment.But India's spotty reform record over the last decade has made investors wary. Bureaucratic procedures, legal delays and political wrangling have held up reform moves.RATING REVISED TO NEGATIVELast week global rating agency Fitch revised India's sovereign rating outlook to negative from stable, citing fiscal concerns, the slow pace of privatisation and deterioration in the country's foreign investment climate. Competing agency Moody's sees signs of slippage in the reforms, and Standard & Poor's has expressed worries over India's budget deficit.Prabhu said he wants to overhaul state power utilities by introducing standard accounting policies, cutting transmission and distribution losses to 15 percent, and tackling crushing debt, thus helping to lure foreign investment into the sector.The poor financial health of the utilities, expected to run up combined losses of about $6 billion in the 2001/02 fiscal year, has proved a hurdle in efforts to draw private investment.Prabhu said an expert panel examining ways to restructure SEB finances - looking at technical, commercial and tariff issues - is expected to report within a few weeks.\"For the first time we will be preparing commercial data which is internationally accepted. We will be preparing technical data which is internationally appreciable. And thirdly, we'll be creating an information base which will be created by experts and then made available to the states,\" he said.The utilities' transmission and distribution losses run to up to 25 percent of the electricity they generate, compared to a figure of about eight percent internationally, he said.Prabhu wants to trim this to about 15 percent within two or three years.\"In the case of India, I am willing to accept a figure of 14 percent to 15 percent, because to bring it below that will be technically feasible but commercially unviable,\" he added.Other steps to tone up power generation include attempts to link the eastern region with the rest of India, efforts to boost plant load factors through modernisation of equipment, and to persuade people to use energy more efficiently.Prabhu said he is building political will to support these moves through a programme to tell consumers why they can no longer get power cheap, or even free, as many did in the past.

He added that Enron is committed to the IPP and assured Lagosians that they would soon begin to feel the impact.The state government brought forward the June 2001 deadline it set for the commencement of the first phase of the project when it fired the first 30 MW of electricity to the national grid two weeks ago.At the Government House on 23 May, Governor Bola Tinubu said his administration and the contracting firm felt that there was no harm in bringing the date forward and assured that another 30 MW would be added soon. He noted that, contrary to expectations that the project would cover the entire state at a go, it would be in phases and the focus for now would be industrial consumption. \"The concentration for now is not as private homes, we would soon get there,\" Tinubu assured.The controversial IPP programme, which the federal government had at one time been accused of frustrating, has suffered several setbacks, including Enron's initial plan to sell its shares to AES, another American company. Last April was originally fixed for the project's take-off but the failure of Trevi, a construction company in charge of transmitters, caused a shift in the date.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.06/04/2001Business Line (The Hindu)SOON after Mr George W. Bush Jr. won the US elections, Indian observers proclaimed quickly that a Republican administration bodes good for India. A Republican administration was expected to not pester India about human rights violations in Kashmir, not force it to sign the CTBT, and get tougher with China.Mr George Bush's decision to \"drop by\" the External Affairs Minister, Mr Jaswant Singh's meeting with the American National Security Advisor, Ms Condoleezza Rice, seemed to somehow confirm this false sense of euphoria. This narrow thinking fails to understand the drivers of Republican ideology. The reality is the Republicans care about a range of issues that will force the BJP Government to make some difficult decisions.Take the first issue of human rights violations in Kashmir. It is true there are many isolationists in the Republican Party who, probably, do not care about human rights violation in Kashmir so long as it does not affect them, and is not happening in their backyard. But there is another powerful force in Republican politics - the religious wing. This includes powerful members of the US Cabinet such as The Attorney-General, Mr John Ashcroft, who are Christian fundamentalists.Mr Bush himself claims to be a 'born again Christian'.The religious right is rarely interested in foreign policy; it mostly concerns itself with moral and social issues such as abortion and teenage pregnancy. But the few times it does intervene, it is when it feels a country is \"persecuting Christians\". And when it does intervene, no Republican administration dares cross it.For instance, China is periodically identified as a country that persecutes Christians. Christian missionaries and ministers are routinely harassed and imprisoned because they are trying to spread their religion. Because of this issue, Republican members of the Christian right in Congress have all but declared a religious war on China, routinely opposing any attempt to improve relations - including trade relations - with that country.India, as an emerging power, is more carefully watched, and frequently mentioned in the American press. Stories of Christian missionaries being burnt alive and nuns raped are attributed to \"elements associated with the Hindu fundamentalist ruling party\". In its latest human rights report, the US State Department noted these acts with concern.The Pope's mention of these issues to the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was also noted in the American press. India is, perhaps, half a step away from being branded as a country that \"persecutes Christians\".A self-professed born-again Christian like Mr George Bush would quickly take up the Christian right's cause, trumping all other bilateral issues. Human rights may not matter to the isolationists, but Christian, and to a lesser extent Jewish, religious freedom matters tremendously to a Republican administration.The second fallacy was that since the Republicans in Congress did not pass the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, they would not force other countries to pass the CTBT either. But why are the Republicans are opposed to the CTBT. The opponents of the CTBT feel that it fails to safeguard American security. They frankly care little about Indian security. They would love to be able to restrict India's ability to test and use its weapons. To them, nuclear weapons not in American hands translates into an unsafe world. Unless India manages to convince the Republicans otherwise, the Republican administration is likely to tighten the anti-proliferation screws on India.The third fallacy relates to a tough, long-term strategic re-alignment the Bush Administration will demand of India. Mr Bush's foreign policy-makers are unreconstructed 'Cold Warriors'. In the post-Cold War era, they are desperately \"searching for an enemy\". They appear to have settled on China as \"the next enemy\". Their next step is to search for \"allies\"who rarely challenge their views. Thinkers in Washington and New Delhi believe that India and the US are \"natural allies\". But such a decision has an enormous range of long-term consequences for India.The Americans are reserving their missile defence system for their \"closest allies\". India today is neither fish nor fowl - not quite a threat, but not quite an ally either. It is unlikely that India will be able to convince the Americans to give it the defence system.Even if the Americans agree to sell it to India, it could never afford the sticker price. So, before it rejoices at the notion of anti-China hawks in the White House, let India ponder over the unexamined consequences.The final issue is one that may precipitate in the very near term.Enron and Maharashtra find themselves in a dispute that neither wants to lose, and that appears to be rapidly getting shriller. Mr George Bush's background is as a Texas oilman - and he is widely accused in the US of being beholden to the interests of the energy industry.In fact, they were among the biggest \"contributors to his campaign\".The Enron Chairman, Mr Kenneth Lay, is a friend of Mr Bush's, and was seriously considered for a job in his Cabinet. He is so well connected that he was recently accused of influencing who is appointed by the White House to regulate the energy industry. In the near term, Mr Bush could quite possibly lean heavily on New Delhi to \"make sure that Enron's interests are not neglected\". If New Delhi does not respond to his satisfaction, his opinion of India, and consequently, his administration's dealings with the country, are likely to be coloured far more than we think.Giridhar SrinivasanCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Enron's Indian Creditors Seek to Salvage Dabhol ProjectEnron's Indian Creditors Seek to Salvage Dabhol ProjectMumbai, June 4 (Bloomberg) -- Indian banks that loaned moneyto Dabhol Power Corp., the local unit of Enron Corp., will try andpersuade their international counterparts to keep alive the $3billion project at a meeting of lenders in Singapore tomorrow.The two-day meeting will be the first between the two groupsof bankers since they met in London on April 24-25 to discuss anescalating dispute on power prices that has pitted Enron againstthe Maharashtra State Electricity Board, Dabhol's only customer.``We will discuss how we can go about resolving theproblem,'' R.S. Agarwal, executive director at IndustrialDevelopment Bank of India, or IDBI, said. IDBI is the biggestlender to the Dabhol project.The outcome of the Singapore meeting, to be held in theoffices of ABN Amro Holding NV, one of the biggest internationallenders to the project, will be crucial to the banks, which haveloaned as much as $2 billion to Dabhol.Indian banks fear the Maharashtra State Electricity Board'sdecision to stop buying power from Dabhol may strengtheninternational lenders' resolve to terminate the project and invokegovernment guarantees to recover their loans.``Foreign lenders want to close the (Dabhol) chapter,'' saidPradyumna Kaul, an activist with Enron Virodhi Andolan, a non-government organization opposed to the project. ``They are eagerto call in their loans, even if it means taking a 10 to 15 percentcut, rather than spend more on supervision and legal expenseswhile watching the saga linger.''Local banks such as IDBI are most at risk as the Maharashtraand federal governments have guaranteed only foreign banks' loansof about $600 million to the venture.IDBI alone has exposure totaling 21.58 billion rupees ($460million) to the project, including 15.28 billion rupees inguarantees.Foreign lenders such as ABN Amro, Citibank N.A., a unit ofCitigroup Inc., Bank of America and Credit Suisse First Boston inApril approved Dabhol's decision to begin termination of its powersupply contract with the board. They are in favor of canceling theproject.India's government risks having to pay 170 billion rupees infines, resulting from guarantees it has offered on payments andloans, if Enron pulls out of the project.The FightMaharashtra State Electricity Board Wednesday stopped buyingpower from Dabhol as the dispute escalated. The board on May 24told Dabhol Power Co. it was canceling its power purchasecontract, six days after Dabhol gave the board notice it was setto pull out of the project because of the six-month dispute overbills owed by the board.``The MSEB's move has complicated the matter. We did notexpect MSEB to do this,'' Agarwal at IDBI said last week.Dabhol, 65 percent owned by Enron, and the board are indispute over 3 billion rupees in unpaid bills for December andJanuary. Others bills through March have been paid.The board has refused to pay the December and January bills,saying they should be lowered to reflect a 4 billion rupee penaltythe board imposed on Dabhol for not supplying power at fullcapacity on Jan. 28.The dispute Thursday prompted debt-rating company Fitch tochange its outlook on India to ``negative'' from ``stable.'' Fitchsaid the climate for foreign investors has deteriorated.``The dispute indicates that India's government may not bewilling to live up to its contractual obligation,'' the EconomicTimes quoted Kristin Lindow, India analyst at Moody's InvestorsService, as saying. ``As a consequence, this would further deterforeign director investment from coming into the country.''Moody's and Standard & Poor's have stable outlooks on thecountry's sovereign rating. S&P has an investment grade rating of``BBB'' on the country's sovereign debt. Moody's, like Fitch,rates India's debt as junk at ``BB2.''Sydney, June 4 (Bloomberg) -- Joseph Hirl, chief executive ofEnron Corp.'s Japanese unit, Enron Japan Corp., comments on theoutlook for deregulation of Japan's electricity industry. He spokeat the Coaltrans Asia conference in Sydney.``The government does have a strong commitment toderegulation, but there are some significant policy concerns''including a ``greater than 80 percent reliance on imports'' ofenergy.``The market has been open a bit over a year, however notmuch has happened. No genuine competition exists under the currentsystem. The companies there recognize that it will happen. It'sinevitable.``The level of competition in Japan now is similar to theU.S. in 1994-95, or Europe in 1996-97. Prices are about 400percent higher than the U.S.``To put it in perspective, I won't give the name of thislarge chemical company, but it consumes about 600 megawatts. Ifyou compare that business with a company that's just like it inHouston, Texas, the difference would be about $250 million a yearin the cost of electricity.``For such an export-led economy, that's a difficultsituation to be in, and it's contributing to the overall malaisein the economy.''On the likelihood of a California-style electricity crisis in``Despite exploitation of California by the utilities, METI(Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) and others recognize itwas a problem of design, not competition'' in California."

  "FERC Order on Morgan Stanley Complaint Against ISO": [

This really puts CA and the ISO on notice thatthey cannot confiscate the power as they seem ready to do -- FERC reiteratesthat the generators can sell power wherever they want because the cap is acap on ISO purchases.  ANd if the ISO want to set a sale price cap it has tofile with FERC, wait 60 days and amend its contractAM ---------------------------<rschlanert@electric.com>, <Bruno_Gaillard@enron.com>, <kmagrude@enron.com>,<mpetroch@enron.com>, <susan_j_mara@enron.com>, <athomas@newenergy.com>,<bchen@newenergy.com>, <Jeff.Hanson@phaser.com>, <anchau@shellus.com>,<andrew.madden@utility.com>, <ben.reyes@utility.com>,<chris.king@utility.com>, <david.bayless@utility.com>We have good news on the ISO price caps front.  The FERC has made itclear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell toISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is tolift the price caps.On Friday, the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July10 complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (\"MS\").  As you mayrecall, MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISO's maximum purchase priceauthority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions.  MSsought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule 206(h), which was granted byFERC on the grounds that the complaint \"warrants expeditious action.\"As a quick background summary for you, last November, FERC issued an orderapproving Tariff Amendment 21 which extended ISO's price cap authoritythrough 11/15/00.  That order stated that the ISO \"maximum purchase price wasnot a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO, but a cap on what the ISOwas willing to pay.\"  The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with theprice cap could \"choose to sell those services into the California PowerExchange or bilateral markets.\"FERC notes in Friday's Order that the 6/28 the ISO's Board resolution loweredthe caps to $500 and ISO further directed that, \"To the extent permitted bylaw, regulation and pre-existing contract, Management shall direct generatorsto bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds 38,000 MW.\"The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would,\"threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace.\"  MS also requestedan emergency technical conference to examine ISO's justification for theprice cap reduction.FERC denied the MS stay request, as well as its request that the $750 maximumpurchase price be reinstated.  The Commission reiterates that it is notapproving a cap on sellers' prices, because they can sell at whatever pricethey want.  Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing topay.  \"Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO, the ISO cannotdictate their price.\"Importantly, however, FERC also states that, \"ISO has no more or less abilityto procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services....ifthe ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announcedpurchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if theychoose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary tomeet its needs.\"  [Emphasis added]  FERC then notes that this may lead to anincrease in Out of Market (\"OOM\") calls and that OOM calls are not subject toa maximum purchase price.Also, with regard to the ISO's resolution stating that generators must bidtheir capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds 38,000 MW, FERCstates clearly that, \"such a requirement is not permitted by our November  12Order and the ISO tariff.\"  [Emphasis added]FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with amaximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISO's marketrules, which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment toISO's tariff.  This would require 60 days' advance notice, \"and could not beimplemented prior to Commission approval.  As stated above, our November 12Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequatesupply (due to a low maximum purchase price) is to raise the maximum purchaseprice.\"ISO is then \"put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must beaccompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the properresponse to low supplies in the ISO markets.\"Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert.  Massey suggeststhat the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues, such as riskmanagement tools, removing constraints on hedging opportunities, introducingreal time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of newgeneration and transmission projects in California.  Hebert says that theprevious November Order tried to \"straddle the fence\" and that, \"Today, theCommission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction ofrecognizing that we have a role.\"  He then reiterates his preference forremoving all price caps.  He also suggests that, \"Getting to the bottom ofthe problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind ourapproval of the ISO as operator of the California grid.  The record supportssuch a move.\"  He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter,stating that it, \"thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of areturn to 'command and control.' \"  Hebert states that, \"The independence ofthe ISO's governing structure stands threatened.  We should 'stand up,' toquote the resignation letter.\"  Hebert advocates opening a section 206proceeding now, as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk powermarkets, \"including the California markets.\"This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrow'smeeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at thatprice.  This is an important development and very good news in our ongoingefforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO.Please call if you have any questions.Dan"

  "FERC Presentation on California/West Wholesale Market": [

Ellen Wolf (of TaborsCaramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentationsby Tim Belden and Dave Parquet.  In the presentation and the meeting we madeThere isn't much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not inthe wholesale market.  We discouraged FERC from taking any action that wouldhurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the Westas well.High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission doesanything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercisedby any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while stillincenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent levelequal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt.The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused byscarcity.  They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load,therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real timeprices.  My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fundas an asset allocation scheme.The market would function better if more information was provided to themarket.The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load.To see the presentation, detach, save, and view in Powerpoint.  When you do,you will find there are many \"hidden\" slides that were not part of the oralpresentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additionalinformation.According to the head of the investigation (Scott Miller), the staff got alotmore out of this meeting than Staff's previous meetings with the IOUs and thegenerators.  Based on the numerous phone calls I've been getting, the Staffis looking into the data we provided.I have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent toScott Miller on Friday.  Tim's version conveys the same message but takes adifferent approach to conveying the message.  On Friday, Tim talked to Scottand answered some additional questions.  Tim said that Enron is in favor ofeliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and would like the IOUs to beable to buy from Enron Online.  He also explained more fully the existence ofscarcity ."

Also Warren thought that he might be able tochange the variation limit from about $10 million to $6 million.  This changewould allow us to use the line for $14 million for original margin (they havea good rate.)  Warren is going to call you about it.  Sarah"

He wanted to know how to increase business with Enron.  I referredhim to you.  As you know, he is so nice and not trying to start a fight withus but needs more trades to justify the cost of the line.  Will you pleaseaddress this with him?Thanks, Sarah"

    "John - you may have already heard this but on Friday, NYMEX increased margins for clearing brokers posting for Enron by 50%.  Also Soc Gen cancelled their margin line on Friday (Warren wants to make it very clear that it was Soc Gen and not Fimat.)  So far, Fimat is not reducing its trading limit with us but is passing through the NYMEX requirement.  All of our brokers will have the right to do this and I expect them to do so.  Sarah"

  "Forbes Article-Gas Fired Power Plants": [
    "Don't know if you saw this already.  Interesting.KenIndigestionDaniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01All those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not.For natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE's Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid.Ah, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as $10 last year. (A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation's electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen.Studness determined that 79% of the \"new\" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there's plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand.Addressing a Burning IssueIf natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn.WINNERS  \t\t\tSales* ($bil) \tRemarksCalpine \t\t\t\t$4.6 \t\tIts gas power plants won't compete with coal for yearsChesapeake Energy \t\t0.9 \t\tHedged gas production through December 2003Dynegy \t\t\t43.4 \t\tOwns gas, coal power plants; stores, trades gasPeabody Energy \t\t2.7 \t\tWorld's largest coal companyLOSERS  \t\t\tSales* ($bil) \tRemarksDevon Energy \t\t\t3.3 Gas-heavy; \t$8 billion in ...debtGeneral Electric \t\t129.5 \t\tSells gas turbinesPioneer Natural Resources \t1.0 \t\t$1.5 billion in ...debt; 53% of production is gasTransocean SedcoForex \t1.9 \t\t$4 billion in debt; heavy gas-drilling exposure\"It's not our game to compete with coal or nuclear,\" says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build gas-fired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. \"It's our game to displace older gas.\"Combined-cycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. The oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500. Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day.That scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houston-based Dynegy, an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. Dynegy's 35-year-old coal plants are \"huge capital hogs,\" Bergstrom says, that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. Throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down, Bergstrom says.But coal-plant owners can be ingenious. Witness Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. By changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output from the 40-year-old plants 12% last year--while reducing emissions. John Long, vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks he can coax another 15% increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules."

  "French GDP, the last good news before the fall?": [
    "French GDP, the last good news before the fall?GDP (Q3)French GDP is clearly a good surprise. However it owes much to one offeffects from tax cuts which boosted consumption. The other elements of theGDP have remained quite weak. If consumption falters next quarter (as weexpect) GDP growth could end up being much lower. Hence we remain verycautious on the medium term.French GDP accelerated in Q3 at +0.5% qoq. Part of this good news ishowever due to the fact that Q2 was revised down (+0.2%qoq instead of+0.3%).* Household consumption is the reason for the good number, it was up 1.2%qoq (after +0.3% in Q2) and contributed to 0.7% to GDP growth. This goodperformance is essentially the result of one off tax cuts, notably theemployment premium paid at the beginning of September. These effects shouldvanish away in Q4 and the preliminary information available for Octoberretail sales indeed support this view.* Other elements of final domestic demand are much more modest. Investmentremained virtually flat with a mere +0.1% qoq increase. We expected acontraction hence the resilience of investment is a small positive for us.However, investment should remain in the doldrums as long asindustrialists' prospects are as low as currently.* Stocks contributed negatively (-0.4% qoq) to growth. This is not really asurprise given the surge in consumption. But this is a positive element fornext quarter, stocks are likely to be back up.* Both exports and imports plummeted again reflecting the deterioration ofinternational trade. Exports were down 1.5% qoq (like in Q2) while importsfell 1.5% qoq as well (after -1.0% in Q2). Overall, the contribution fromnet trade was thus flat, in line with our expectations. But this could gointo negative territory as foreign demand will continue to weaken.St?phane D?oEconomic ResearchUBS WarburgStephane.deo@ubsw.com"

Hence an analysis of the DOE cost  and quality ofgeneration fuels is incomplete becasue of the lack of NUG data. WEFA getsaround this by using 1998 FERC FORM I data.

    "COMMENTSEUR SWAPSFlow of the day was large and consistent paying of 2s and 3s as they werepaid in blocks of 250-500mm throughout the course of the session. This hadthe effect of flattening 2/10s by an impressive 8bps and of widening swapspreads by about 0.75bps in that part of the curve while spreads elsewhereclosed the day pretty much unchanged. Further out the curve, we saw stronginterest in the 5/10 spread though it's unclear if this was new risk orprofit taking from the dealer community. With regard to spreads, I'mwondering if it makes sense to put on a swap spread widener here with a veryshort term view. Swap spreads blew out in the US yday as the market got thesense that most of the new issuance was out of the way and given how wellEUR spreads held in despite yday's Singtel, ATT, and EIB pricing, perhapsEUR spreads are due for a small correction. Still like the narrower longerterm, just thinking on a very short term basis.WHY THE FED WILL BE SLOW TO TIGHTENIn our view the econ recovery is not likely to be very powerful. There arelarge imbalances in the household and corporate sectors and the sources ofstimulus (mortgage financing, etc) are likely to be much less thanpreviously expected. Additionally, while it is true the nominal rates havefallen sharply, the decline in real rates is roughly half of the decline innominals. On the inflation front, we believe inflation is likely to declinefurther as a consequence of both excess capacity and higher unemployment.With most major indices at 2.5% or lower, the Fed can be much more patientthan normal when they consider whether or not they need to take back some ofthe 450bps of easing. Overall, we believe the Fed will want the econ to growat an above trend rate in order to psh it back to full employment butagainst this we have a market that is now incorporating a signif amount oftightening over the next near (Dec Euro$ up 90bps in the last week). Evenbuilding in a risk premium of 10bps per contract, a 25bp sprd between 3mlibor and fed funds, and 15bps of year end pressure, this still impliesabout 100bps of tightening by 2003. While not impossible, it neitherreflects the Fed's thinking nor appears anywhere close to the center of ourprobability distrubtion.USD SWAPS/VOLAnother 3 standard deviation event yday, with the sell-off in treasuriessnowballing as negatively convex portfolios capitulated into selling bypaying fixed at higher rates. The cork was finally removed from thepressurized bottle in spreads - with most corporate deals out of the way -and took their natural course by widening by 5bps. We saw heavy flows, withpaying across all sectors, save the very long end.Vols were up on the day. Gamma shot up 0.5bps/day, which is a pretty largemove; longer expiries were up about 0.2bps/day, which is in line with themarket price of skew. Flows were not as heavy as one might have expected; atleast for the time being.The market is clearly saying that this is the turn in the economy, and thatwe're already heading for a sharp recovery, with aggressive Fed tighteningaction over 2002. This seems to be somewhat premature. With no inflation insight, and still big signs of weakness in the economy, it is unlikely thatthe Fed will reverse its course this fast. Whilst this sell-off might not beover in the near term, (expect high volatility), we remain constructive onthe outlook for rates in the medium term.IPOs & CORPORATE ISSUANCEBoth the coporate bond market and the equity IPO market seem to berecovering a bit here. The avg spread tightening on the 3 Sing Tel and4-fixed rate ATT tranches is 19bps between where the deal was priced ydayand where it opened this morning. On the equity side, not only are our seclending people telling us that short interest is decreasing (ie more pplecovering shorts), but IPO calendar is also firming up. The US market had itsbusiest week of the year with 5 IPOS & 15 secondary offerings and can lookforward to the $3bln Prudential next month while Europe pitched in with a$3bln convert deal for Swiss Re and expects some $9bln in new issuance bythe end of the year. While it's unclear how much underwater portfolios willlook to take on new posns going into year end and while this flood ofissuance may simply be due issuers looking to tie up loose ends before yearend, it does appear the global investor base is becoming a bit morereceptive to new deals.LEVELS (close to close, ex basis)SWAP CURVEGBP/EUR(EUR convention)today \t  t-15y5y\t\t -25\t\t -2515y15y\t -144\t\t -14210/30?\t -39.0\t -37.510/30E       +44.8\t +46.0EUR SWAP SPREADSGBP SWAP SPREADSEUR SWAP VOLATILITY3m into 10yr\t13.9 \tunch1y into 10yr\t12.6 \t0.3 lower2y into 10y\t\t12.3 \t0.2 lower5y into 5y\t\t12.1\tunch5y into 25y\t\t10.1\t0.2 lower10y into 20y\t9.4\t0.2 lower5y5y swaption/5x10 cap spread\t2.3SCHATZ BASIS TO DECBko 3.75% Sep 03\t12.0 gross bid,1.40% repo offer,0.0 netDbr 6% Sep 03\t20.0 gross bid,1.85% repo offer,-0.9 netTha 6% Nov 03\t37.0 gross bid,3.15% repo offer,23.2 netBOBL BASIS TO DECObl 138\t7.8 gross bid,\t2.50%\trepo offer,\t  -1.7 netJan 07\t39.0 gross bid,\t3.15% repo offer,   26.7 netBUND BASIS TO DEC5.25% July 10\t11.5 gross bid,2.20% repo offer,-3.4 net5.25% Jan 11\t57.0 gross bid,3.20% repo offer,48.4 netThis material is for your private information, and we are not soliciting anyaction based upon it.

    "COMMENTSDANISH INSURERSAs expected yday, Danish regulators reduced the discount rate used to valueinsurance liabilities from 4.00% to 3.75% despite the fact that the formulacalled for them to reduce the rate to as low as 3.5%. This marks yet anothermeeting where the Council reduced the rate by less than what was dictated bythe formula and this likely reflects the lobbying pressure being applied bythe Danish insurance industry. The attached graph plots the discount raterequired by the formula (not the rate chosen by regulators) vs 5y5y EUR vol.It's interesting to note that vol reached it's peak EXACTLY when thediscount rate reached its trough. It's also interesting to note how quicklyvol sold off when the discount rate rebounded from the 3.50% low (asequities rebounded). Overall, while we suspect there will be some smallerfunds feeling some pain with this latest reduction, it's likely much lessthan the forced buying that we probably would have seen if the rate wasreduced by the amount required by the formula. Going forward, it seems thebest guide to the performance of long dated vol and cash in Euroland is theoverall level of the index. Happy to provide more information on this if youwant more clarification.<<dkkvol.doc>>EUR SWAPSOne of the quietest days of the year yday as the market rallied and theTresor was nowhere to be seen. Will be interesting if today's weaknessbrings them back into the market. Tresor aside, the focus now shifts to anincreasing corporate pipeline that will see a 750mm 5y deal from Alcatel,and 500mm 7yr deal from Tomkins, a 5y or 7y deal from Metro, and a 500mm 10ydeal from Royal Ahold coming to the market over the next several days. Withswap spreads very close to their tightest levels of the year, we've seenlittle interest in swap spread widening positions & with the Tresor loomingand issuance increasing, we suspect spreads will continue on theirtightening path for at least the balance of the week. Overall, it seems thisweek will provide a very good barometer of how the rest of the year will befrom a flow perspective as there appears to be little incentive tojeopardize yearly performance (good or bad) by committing large amounts ofcapital to a market that's been particularly vicious over the past twoweeks.EUROPE TRADING VIEWOur overall trading view is to buy on weakness and sell on strength thisweek. Due to illiqudity and lack of risk capital commitment before year end,and no major economic data to turn the market around, our trading strategythis will likely be BUY AND TRADE, wait until new year, and then BUY AND*\tNote that Europe and US have began to sell off at the same time.Based on empirical studies, the simultaneous sell off usually signals acorrection, not a prolonged bear market.*\t5s in Europe have under performed very sharply relative to thebeginning of all previous bear markets.  Note that supply in that sector isnow behind us, and supply will concentrate in 10 year sector in next twoweeks.*\tStocks, Bonds and commodities market have all thrown in the towelfor a V shape recovery.  What's the probability that all three markets arewrong?*\tMSCI reweightings this week.  Our research estimated 4.7 billion outof Eurozone and about 4.2 billion into UK.  However, this news is priced inthe market in our opinion.  If European fixed income sold off because of thereweightings this week, we would fade that trade and go long European fixedincome.LEVELS (close to close, ex basis)SWAP CURVEGBP/EUR(EUR convention)today \t  t-15y5y\t\t  -20\t\t  -2015y15y\t -139 \t -14110/30?\t -36.0\t -38.010/30E       +43.5\t +43.5GBP SWAP SPREADSEUR SWAP SPREADSEUR SWAP VOLATILITY3m into 10yr\t14.9 \t0.1 higher1y into 10yr\t13.5 \t0.1 higher2y into 10y\t\t12.9 \tunch5y into 5y\t\t13.1\t0.1 higher5y into 25y\t\t11.0\t0.1 higher10y into 20y\t10.4\t0.1 higher5y5y swaption/5x10 cap spread\t2.3This material is for your private information, and we are not soliciting anyaction based upon it.

    "COMMENTSPRICE ACTION THIS AMDespite markets trading lower out of the gates on rumors of Bin Laden'scapture, customer flows we've seen have been skewed to the buyside. We'vehad buying of euribor, selling of puts on dec bund futures, and buying ofbunds/bobls/schatz on an outright basis. This just feels like a case of themarket getting way too bullish way too soon. As for flows, the vast majorityof our accounts seem to have taken most of their chips off the table a fewdays ago though there's obviously some large positions still remaining.While we don't advocate going long just yet as we believe there'spotentially another day or two of weakness here, we certainly think it'stime to begin to cover shorts and at least contemplate going long again. Wedon't give much weight to the Bin Laden rumor, fyi. Additionally, I heardtwo interesting pieces of anecdotal evidence recently - two very prominentbusiness schools (one in the US and one in Europe who usually place at least95% of their graduates by this time of the year have placed just 50% and 5%respectively of their graduating classes.EUR SWAPSYet another day of very solid receiving in 10yr swaps. As we mentionedpreviously, we thought the Tresor would re-enter the market if we weakenedagain. Well, we did and they did. We estimate roughly EUR2bln 10yrs tradedas 10yr swap spreads closed another 1bp tighter on the day. Given wherewe've opened today, we expect to see more receiving pressure yet again.Additionally, 2/5/10 looks quite convex here at -11bps and we expect to seedealers taking this position off later today - we've already seen one propaccount take some off today. On the new issuance front, while the EUR5bln 5yEIB deal will be priced today, it's already been swapped and our best guessis that the continental bank that took down the bobl 138 yday did so againstthe receiving they've done in the run up to this deal. So today, we expectthem to pay in 5yrs vs bobls to get net flat the sector. We also get theEUR750mm deal for Deutsche Bahn later today and while it was supposed to beswapped yday, the rumor is that it was postponed and will likely be swappedin the next day and a half.EUR VOLVol's been marked down pretty dramatically over the past two days as weclosed virtually the entire surface 1 vol lower on the day & 1.5 vol loweron the week. While there was definitely some liquidation in the street,sizes were not that large and clips of 100-150mm were enough to move themarket substantially. As liquidity was pretty lousy on the way up, it's nosurprise that there's little liquidity on the way down. We've also had a fewquestions about the skew - ie, if it's being priced less aggressively can weexpect to see the Danes come back - but the answer from our guys is that ifit's illiquid in the ATM stuff, the OTM stuff is even worse. Having saidthat, the formula that dictates the rate used to discount Danish liabilitiessays they now need to use a lower rate (3.50%, down from 4% currently) andif this rate is marked down a further 50bps at the meeting in 2 weeks time,the long end bid to both cash and vol could return. Having said that, ifequities continue to grind higher - and our sec lending guys tell us overallshort interest is decreasing - the forced selling may not come to fruition.Nevertheless, something to watch.....LEVELS (close to close, ex basis)SWAP CURVEGBP/EUR(EUR convention)today \t  t-15y5y\t\t -25\t\t -2715y15y\t -142\t\t -14010/30?\t -37.5\t -34.010/30E       +46.0\t +47.1EUR SWAP SPREADSGBP SWAP SPREADSEUR SWAP VOLATILITY3m into 10yr\t13.9 \t0.7 lower1y into 10yr\t12.9 \t0.7 lower2y into 10y\t\t12.5 \t0.7 lower5y into 5y\t\t12.1\t1.0 lower5y into 25y\t\t10.3\t0.7 lower10y into 20y\t9.6\t0.8 lower5y5y swaption/5x10 cap spread\t2.5This material is for your private information, and we are not soliciting anyaction based upon it.

    "unfortunately, mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do.  thequestion is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job ofcorrecting for violations of the black scholes model.  in my mind, there arethree big reasons for skew.  one is that the assumption of stochasticvolatility as a function of price level gets violated.  commodities tend tohave long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply andelasticity of the demand curve.  nat gas tends to be relatively stable whenwe are in that historical pricing environment.  however, moving to adifferent pricing regime tends to bring volatility.  an options trader wantsto be long vol outside the trading range, believing that a breakout of therange leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium.  supports avol smile theory.  in addition, in some commodities realized vol is afunction of price level.  nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at$4 and more volatile at $4 than $3.  thus there has been a tendency for allcalls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negativeskew.  the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come offin a declining market and increase in a rising market.  to test, regress 15day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation.second reason is heptocurtosis, fatter tails than lognormal distributionpredicts.  supports vol smile theory.  easy to test how your market comparesby plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expecteddistribution.third, is just supply and demand.  in a market where spec players arebearish, put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurancepremium to add incremetal risk to the book.  if you have a neutral viewtowards market, or believe that market will come off but in an orderlyfashion, enron can take advantage of our risk limits by selling moreexpensive insurance.  crude market tends to have strong put skew and weakfences.  if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of prices where thefence strikes are, can be profitable to take other side of trade.if you want to discuss further give me a call 4-6 pm houston time.  hope thishelps,johnSharad AgnihotriJohn, MikeI work for the London Research team and am looking atsome option pricing problems for the UK gas desk.Dave Redmond the options trader told me that you had donesome fundamental research regardingthe gas implied volatility smiles and may be able to help.I would be grateful if you tell mewhat you have done or suggestsomeone else that I could ask.RegardsSharad Agnihtori"

Our hearts go out to all the employeeswho will not only loose their employment but also most, if not all, oftheir savings.  As you know, I've always thought a lot of you; not onlyfor your trading skills, but also as a person.  You are one of thelargest and most influential traders in the market, yet do not have theannoying ego so often found in traders of your stature.   I'm absolutelysure that you'll do well no matter where your career takes you.  I justwanted you to know that if there is ever anything I can do for you,please don't hesitate to call.  This is not a solicitation foremployment.  This is from a person who always felt you treated mehonestly and fairly and if the occasion arises, would like toreciprocate."

We need toget a more accurate head count if we would like to have a private Enron eventat the Frank Gehry Exhibit.  Tentatively, we have May 24th on hold and FrankGehry has agreed to be in attendance, which is an added-value. The eventwould be a formal dinner with approximately 150-200 people, including Enronexecutives and their potential/existing customers.  Again, the attendancelist is created through your requests but Enron Corporate covers the cost ofthe event (excluding travel arrangements).We need to make a firm commitment to the Guggenheim by Monday.  Please let meknow approximately how many people you would like to bring by tomorrow. Feelfree to call me at 39056 or email me if you have any questions.Thanks, Margaret"

  "HEY JOHNNY": [
    "i just cant get too enthused about the short side.  why did cash go out trading +5 for a weekend when there was zero power gen demand.  the easy answer is that pipes were short and everybody playing catchup from this week.  fine.  what's it going to trade next week.  the gas daily swap implies flat, but it's lagged the actual spread all month.  i think cash surprises by trading positive next week with no power gen.  this market is not trading like we run out of injection space.  so either the market is wrong (maybe but a dangerous assumption to make) or I don't see why sep is so overvalued relative to the rest of the curve.  you can certainly argue that the winter and cal 2 are too high, but those certainly don't seem to be going down very fast.  march is off 8 cents since jun 29.  so if the market wants to say that march is worth 354, then why is sep too high at 298?-----Original Message-----timing-i think if we come in monday and normal weather actually shows upthey wack this thing-----Original Message-----things back to normal around here, which unfortunately is boring.  tired ofmy apartment, tired of my girlfriends, a few more weeks like this and I'llbe tired of my job.  need something to juice up my life.  vacation wasgood.  took a few days in belize to get certified for scuba.  very cool.then a weeklong finance class at wharton.  good to learn something new fora change.very few views of the market here.  not sure that all the bearishness isnot already built into the market.  problem is the bearish sentiment isstill tremendously pervasive.  everybody, everybody, everybody, is shortbut wants a rally to 315 to sell more.  just not sure what the downsidetarget is.  cash isnt behaving like we're gonna run out of injection spacein october.  if i owned a proprietary storage field and thought we'dapproach shut-ins in late oct and be at a much lower level, i either wouldnot inject now or better yet, i'd withdraw now to have room for all that $2gas later.  but hell, the cash market is trading over prompt.  not justbecause it's hot, it's been doing so for about 3 weeks now.  thus i could,in fact the storage economics tell me i should, withdraw gas or definitelynot inject so i could have flexibility later.  something doesnt add up.the spec market is convinced we're going to shut in but the phys market isnot telling the same story.  so let's assume we're not at shut-ins or havetrouble placing gas in october.  is the market overpriced?  don't think itnecessarily is considering the winter will have a risk premium associatedwith it regardless of the fundamentals after last winter until we get thefirst weather forecast of the winter.  i think we could stay at this pricelevel for a while and then have the next move down late oct early nov whenpeople try to withdraw gas and nobody wants it.  i think it was in 99 whenthe first 3 weeks of nov were injection.  can you imagine going into decwith 3.15?   but if there is injection capabililty through oct 31, and thewinter is going to stay relatively high due to risk premium, how far arethe storage spreads going to widen?biggest position right now is short jv and short a ton of u vol.producers are waiting for any move up in cal 2 to give it a spanking.falling back in love with longer term gas though.  think 2/3 and 2/4spreads are golden.thoughts?-----Original Message-----how it goes my man. its all good here. finally getting settled into mypersonal life-got the family moved ,in the new house etc. john paul wasupthis past weekend and he came over to my place to sy hi. good guy-has acoolchic.ive been meaning to email you but as always busy as hell. i haddinnerwith bo collins last nite and a few cocktails-funny to see him changingroles. i enjoy talking to him but hes being quite the diplomat now.seemsthe new role fits him actually and he seems to be enjoying it.still hardforme to believe hes not gonna miss trading.hows business/life and the vaca? what are your thos ont he mkt?demand has come back a great deal but im not sure its gonnahelp-maybetoo little too late. ive been trading this a little mroe actively nowthatthe mkts been leaning mosrtly one say but fortuntely sold early in theweekon the rally before the aga-and after.biggest problem for muchlowerpricesin the short term is it seems now the whole mkt has the same supply anddemand view. but if we can believe that production is up 3% which seemstobe the implication we'll have no problm moving about 3.1 tcf(3.2 basisdoe).economic growth will be at best flat to last year thru 2001 and i'dsaythat means the winter will struggle to get much bullishness--ie ourbiggestconcievable draw would be in the order of 2.2 tcf-leaves us around 1 tcfendmarch, hard to get too excited about that. sprds? not much of clue-itend tothink inverses cont to errode like feb/apr-but maybe not until mkt givesupon winter. prepensity for us to stay contango maybe accelerates.thatthisyear.you think we get to shut in levels? since so much prod growth appearstobe from independents does that raise the avg shut in value from say 1.60to$2.00 or higher??anyway-be cool,hope all is well. enjoy the weekend. are you going tobein NYC anytime soon?**********************************************************************This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate andmay contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of theintended recipient (s).

Per yourrequest, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's businesspartners was e-mailed to you this morning.Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales ManagerHouston, TX#(713)-439-5587(Gerry Cashiola's boss)Gerry Cashiola, sales representativeHouston, TX#(713)-439-5555(To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play)Greg Pyle, Solution Control ManagerSoutheast RegionAustin, TX(#(512)-257-5735(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to deferleadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola)Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliancesAustin, TX#(512)-257-5736(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances)Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services SolutionsCupertino, CA#(408)-447-5240(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's businesspropositions; strong technical, financial background to craft valuepropositions.  Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the11/16th meeting)Matt,On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron'strading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unitcenter on the trading floor.  This tour was one meeting, amongst several,held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron'sproducts and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron(EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).On November 16th GSS Business Development,  Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clarkoutlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas  --  connectivity, storage, and1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiolahas stalled on providing this).  Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue thisinformation and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by shortterm opportunity.  What is HP's time horizon for short term?2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi toexplore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS ITSourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14)In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, severalGerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process.  Moreimportantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviewsof Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on theGSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has beenunable to define an HP business proposition.  The coordination betweenCashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) hasremained unorganized.  These initiatives need to be developed separately.Clearly,  the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more seniorlevel so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationshipforward at a strategic level.  As the relationship is developed at thisstrategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way.  ButGerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship,rather a by-product.  To facilitate this process of elevating therelationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy andGreg Pyle.  Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of  HP's America's CentralRegion.In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regardingwireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBSa) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP  to move forward onthe process of building a strategic  relationship  (IBM and Lexmark are onlysome of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP'sbusiness relationship process with EnronPatrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with BillDwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) inthe near term.  Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyerin person.We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this andother opportunities.Sarah-Joy HunterEnron CorporationGlobal Strategic Sourcing - Business Development#(713)-345-6541"

They all loved us for nearly four years - we could not do anything wrong and now they hate everything about us. The investors and the street is silly and stupid.  While one should spend time looking for the next Microsoft, one should spend time looking for the next Enron.As for the future,  I am neutral - we have a fair chance of pulling it through, though there are significant risks. If our strength is the intellectual captial - the traders and marketeres (you never hear the term franchise) - why would they hang out here for too long, the only thing holding them here is availability of capital and the tolerance of that capital to take risk.  Once the capital is gone, its hard to see the traders and deal makers stay.In the end, its  hard to say we will survive to be the biggest and baddest commodity trading house but we sure did pioneer it.Harry-----Original Message-----thought that would catch your attention.

    "PM ---------------------------Warming Up To GreenBY ERIC ROSTONBreathe in. Hold it. Hold it. O.K., now breathe out.Unless you're outdoors in the midst of a cold snap, chances are youcan't seeyour breath. And no one would ever ask you to drop a quarter in a tinbox for theright to free this invisible spirit from your lungs. Yet last November,Murphy OilCorp., based in El Dorado, Ark., voluntarily shelled out several hundredthousand dollars for the right to cough out carbon dioxide, the samestuff youexhaled three sentences ago.The reason it did so is closely related to events that occurred thatsame autumnday, half a world away, at the Hague. Thousands of policymakers andscientistsfrom all over the world had gathered, hoping to dot the i's, cross thezeds andumlaut the o's on the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the U.N. FrameworkConvention onClimate Change. The protocol was devised to curb the industrial emissionof sixgases, CO2 among them, that are slowly--actually quickly in geologicalterms--turning the earth into a hothouse. But no final accord wasreached.In this context, Murphy's purchase of options on 210,000 metric tons ofcarbon(the equivalent of annual exhaust from approximately 27,800 cars) from aCanadian company that was itself trying to help meet a national targetseems abit odd. The market for this kind of trade hasn't been established, andthere isn'teven a global agreement on how carbon dioxide should be valued. Indeedthereisn't even unanimity on global warming itself.Yet the transaction is emblematic of industry on the verge of anenvironmentaltransition. Congress may have snubbed the Kyoto accord, and globalbureaucrats may be stumbling over the details of a carbon-emissionstradingsystem. But corporations, against the run of play, are beginning toconfront theclimate conundrum the best way they know how--as a business opportunity.John Browne, CEO of BP Amoco, and Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman of RoyalDutch/Shell Group, have both responded to the global-warming threat andset upinternal systems that exceed goals put forth in Kyoto. Shell and BP havevowedto cut their greenhouse-gas emissions 10% each--nearly twice the Kyototarget--Shell by 2002, BP by 2010. \"This isn't an act of altruism,\" saysAidanMurphy of Shell. \"It's a fundamental strategic issue for our business.\"And not theirs alone. A growing number of corporations, from IBM to yourneighborhood Kinko's, are reducing their greenhouse footprints. DuPontispledging to knock its emissions 65% below 1990 levels by 2010. \"There'sbeen ashift in the center of gravity in the U.S. corporate community sinceKyoto,\" saysAlden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"Now the view is thatclimatechange is serious and we ought to do something about it.\"and \"capand trade\" emissions. That is, set ceilings for worldwide greenhouse-gasemissionand let nations either sell emission credits if they emit below theirallowance orbuy credits if they exceed permitted levels. The theory is that thepursuit ofgreenbacks will fuel greener business. \"Whenever you turn a pollutioncut into afinancial asset,\" says Joseph Goffman, an attorney at EnvironmentalDefense,\"people go out and make lots of pollution cuts.\"Even where green fervor is of a paler shade, corporations are viewingthepotential for global regulation as a business risk they need toconsider. WitnessClaiborne Deming, Murphy's CEO, who doesn't see the science of globalwarmingas solid enough yet to cry havoc. But Deming hears shareholdersclamoring andthe bureaucrats buzzing. Someone may ask his company to put more than aquarter in that box when it wants to exhale more than its allottedamount of CO2.Breathe in. Hold it. You know the drill.How much CO2 did you just exhale? Tricky question. Yet that's analogousto theone businesses are struggling with on a massive scale. Until they figureit out,companies interested in trading will be on their own to determine 1) howyoubuy the right to emit a gas that has no standard of measurement and 2)how to doso when no nation currently assigns a CO2 property right. \"It's risky ashell,\" saysDeming.Many groups are working to mitigate that risk. The World ResourcesInstituteand others are road-testing a system that would make trading less riskybycreating universal carbon-accounting practices. And fourcompanies--ArthurAndersen, Credit Lyonnais, Natsource and Swiss Re--are developing anexchangewhere companies can trade, even in an embryonic market devoid oflegislativestandards. \"They're trying to nail down something that will be usefulunder lawsthat are not yet defined,\" says Garth Edward, a broker at Natsource, anenergy-trading firm.The U.S. struggled to introduce a cap-and-trade system into the KyotoProtocol,bringingemissions 7% below 1990 levels from 2008 to 2012. The irony of thecurrentsituation is that the Europeans, reluctant to accept trading at first,have becomeits champion; Britain next month will become the first country to embarkon anational trading system.Another practice, still hotly debated, is to assign credits forsequestering carbonin growing forests. Trees soak up limited amounts of CO2, release oxygeninto theair and turn carbon into wood.The Kyoto mechanisms will evaporate without global ratification, thussetting upan early environmental test for President Bush, who campaigned againstthedocument. But Secretary of State Colin Powell has already heardpreliminarybriefings on the matter as the U.S. preps for the next round of talks,to be held inBonn in mid-July. Bush the First helped pioneer credit trading in 1990,when hesigned legislation that capped power plants' sulfur dioxideemissions--the mainingredient in acid rain--but allowed the plants to swap credits. AndHouston-based Enron, an energy trader whose chairman, Ken Lay, was aprominent W. campaign adviser, stands to be a huge player in any suchmarket.So if it's good for business, Bush the ex-businessman won't need thatbig a push.With him or without him, the monetization of carbon emissions--green forgreed's sake, if nothing else--is gaining momentum. So breathe easy. Foryou, it'sstill free. But for many companies, the carbon meter will be runningsoon. In thevery near future, pollution is going to be either a cost to them or anopportunity."

  "Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call": [
    "m..presto@enron.com, mike.carson@enron.com, matt.lorenz@enron.com,j..sturm@enron.com, harry.arora@enron.com, steve.wang@enron.com,robert.stalford@enron.com, dana.davis@enron.com,benjamin.rogers@enron.com-----Original Message----------Original Message-----Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.EES will be a part of the new company.Enron assets will be revalued at closing.The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.In what was termed a \"new approach\", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling.The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.Patrick Tucker"

Cash NeedsSCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=plete=20cash depletion date of February 1, 2001.

  "History of  Lime and Cement": [
    "Folks,I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime anddevelopment of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement -  that Ithink will be interesting to the group.I highly recommend David Moore's book \"The Roman Pantheon\" at $25.00  -   avery thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....limeand clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The bookcovers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily -interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 yearslearning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that havelasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and goodbackground information for sustainable builder folks.Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.Moore</A>Regards,Harry Francis"

Answer the question asked.  Don't be afraid to say you don'tknow but don't make excuses.  Express interest in why you find Enronappealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing.The trading training program is still in the works.  Few people outside thetrading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn't askany questions about it in the interviews.  If you receive an offer, it wouldprobably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter thetraining program when you arrive.  Not sure about that last statementthough.   The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pureother trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fallunder the program.   That's a function of the program being developed by thehead of these two businesses.  Not ready to take it corporate-wide yet.Write me about how your interviews went.JohnHi John,How are you today?  You must be pleased with Enron's most recent numbers.Could you tell me a little more about the trading training program?

The ISO Governing Board earlierthe same day turned down the ISO management's request to force SCs toplace 95% of their scheduled load in the DA market.  That leaves the ISOlittle choice but to venture into the energy markets to procure power tocover their peak hours on hot days.Terry gave Ziad the OK to proceed with placing both the APX andCalifornia PX screens for this new product/matching-service.  I amworking with the two vendors and the ISO to make this happen quickly.We anticipate that the market will open on Tuesday, September 5, orearlier.ISO - Ziad Alaywan  916-351-2140 (Nancy Traweek and Jim McIntosh arealso in the loop)PX - Ken Czarnecki 626-537-3123PX - John Yurkanin 626-537-3124APX - Denice Cazalet 408-517-2123APX - Michael Heinrich 408-517-2159Please feel free to contact me with your questions.  Several of you havenot had the opportunity to attend the pre-design meetings we had at theCalifornia PX and APX a few weeks ago, nor were you aware of the jointWPTF/ISO meeting held last week.  But in essence, what thisproduct/matching-service will allow you to do is post bids to sell, orbuy a 6-hour block of capacity at a firm energy price across the hoursof HE13 to HE18.  You can bid at COB, Mead, PV, SP15 or NP15.  You canutilize either the CalPX or APX to post your bids, because the ISO willbe watching both screens.  The block sizes are (supposed to be) 25MW.The seller is responsible for arranging transmission to the deliverypoint, and the buyer (e.g., ISO) is responsible for arrangingtransmission service from the delivery point.  The ISO will make itssend out a general notice when it needs offers to sell on the super-peakmarket.  I expect that bids for either buy or sell will be able to beposted at any time, 24 hours.  The screens should allow parties to postbuy or sell bids at least 60 days forward of the trade day.You are not limited to a price cap in these markets, but the ISO as abuyer has the right to not purchase at prices above it's price cap.I think WPTF members should be very proud that we were able to quicklywork together, and with the ISO to create this market. I have no doubtthe ISO will be offering bids to purchase starting Sept 5, and goingforward 60 days.  However, who among you will be willing and able topost bids to sell?gba"

    "i read this as though 1.5 bcf/d of more switching takes place in the summerversus today.  is that because of the forward curves are backwardated for 2and contango for natty?Given the shape of the curve, my guess for incremental substitution is1.5Bcf/d for No2 oil.So for the period  May-Sep01 an extra 1.5Bcf/d will be put back into thesystem due to No2 oil usage.Futures Settlements                                          \t\tMar27-01NG\tCL\tBRT\tHO\tGSL\tHU\tPN$/Mmbtu\t$/BBL\t$/BBL\tCts/Gal\t$/ MT\tCts/Gal\tCts/galAPR1\t5.621\t 27.75 \t25.40\t0.7794\t216.25\t0.9395\t0.5375MAY1\t5.661\t 27.84 \t25.50\t0.737\t213.75\t0.9306\t0.5375JUN1\t5.703\t 27.66 \t25.39\t0.7235\t212.25\t0.9111\t0.5400JUL1\t5.738\t 27.40 \t25.26\t0.724\t212.50\t0.8853\t0.5425AUG1\t5.753\t 27.12 \t25.09\t0.727\t213.00\t0.8558\t0.5450SEP1\t5.713\t 26.85 \t24.91\t0.7325\t213.00\t0.819\t0.5475OCT1\t5.708\t 26.58 \t24.73\t0.739\t213.50\t0.7765\t0.5575NOV1 \t5.813\t 26.31 \t24.53\t0.745\t214.25\t0.7525\t0.5600DEC1\t5.913\t 26.03 \t24.27\t0.7490\t215.00\t0.739\t0.5600Futures Settlements  DIFFS VS NG (USD/ MMBTU)   (CDTY-NG)NG\tCL\tBRT\tHO\tGSL\tHU\tPN$/MMBtu\t$/MMBtu\t$/MMBtu\t$/MMBtu\t$/MMBtu\t$/MMBtu\t$/MMBtuAPR1\t0.00\t-0.86\t-1.29\t0.00\t-0.64\t2.19\t0.28MAY1\t0.00\t-0.88\t-1.32\t-0.35\t-0.74\t2.08\t0.24JUN1\t0.00\t-0.95\t-1.38\t-0.49\t-0.81\t1.87\t0.22JUL1\t0.00\t-1.03\t-1.43\t-0.52\t-0.84\t1.62\t0.22AUG1\t0.00\t-1.10\t-1.48\t-0.51\t-0.84\t1.36\t0.23SEP1\t0.00\t-1.10\t-1.47\t-0.43\t-0.80\t1.10\t0.41OCT1\t0.00\t-1.14\t-1.50\t-0.38\t-0.79\t0.75\t0.44NOV1 \t0.00\t-1.30\t-1.63\t-0.44\t-0.88\t0.45\t#REF!DEC1\t0.00\t-1.44\t-1.78\t-0.51\t-0.96\t0.23\t0.23Date\t27-03LegendNG\tNYMEX Nat GasCL\tNYMEX Crude OilBRT\tIPE BrentHO\tNYMEX Heating OilGSL\tIPE GasoilHU\tNYMEX GasolinePN\t1 BBL = 42 GalDate\t27-03ConversionsNG\t1 BBL = 5.825 MMBtuCLBRTHO\t1 BBL = 42 GalGSL\t1 BBL =0.134 MTHU\t1 BBL = 42 GalPN\t1 BBL = 42 GalJen FraserEnron Global Markets Fundamentals713-853-4759"

  "Indicative Pricing for Dominion Resources": [
    "Just got off the phone with the folks @ Dominion regarding some indicative pricing I gave them last week for (i) a 7000 Heat Rate Call in TVA; and, (ii) a 7000 Heat Rate Call in SERC.  FYI, I had quoted the TVA Call  @ $3.97/KW-mo ($1 over our mid) for a 4yr call beginning 1/1/03 with $2 VOM and 5x16 avail with 16hr mins.  I also quoted the SERC 7000 call at $1 over our mid, at $3.98/KW-mo for 1 yr and $4.12/KW-mo for 4 yrs, again with 5x16 and 16 hour mins.The good news is --- this pricing generated some interest.The other (not bad) news is, they want us to refine our quotes in some respects.For the SERC calls, they're really interested in the new RTO GridSouth.  Harry, we need to see if we can identify a product today for what GridSouth will be tomorrow.  In addition, they are really interested in something more akin to a true synthetic, with intraday availability, say 2-3 hour notice with 4 or 8 hour mins.  (Since they are going to compare this to a real plant, I think we can take some latitude in calculating the VOM for shorter dispatch periods, since they would otherwise experience a start charge which would be spread over fewer hours).  Let me know what you think we can do.  We should probably talk about this.On the TVA call, they're happy with the quote I gave them, but would like the flexibility of 8 hour mins.  Let talk about this, as well.  I told them that size on the TVA would be in the range of 200-250.  They will check size on their side and I'd like us to affirm if this works for us, as well.They would also like to see a Peaker Call in TVA with a June'04 start, 3-yr term, 4 hour notice, 4 hour mins, priced for Jun-Aug and Dec-Mar availability.  They'll get back to me on size.  In the meantime, let's talk about what we're interested in.Sorry about the length of this message.  If I don't hear from you in an hour or so, I'll initiate the call.  My NY number is 212-715-5953."

We need to get yourapproval of the points listed below so that we can begin building theapplication.We can have the Position and P&L Reports show the results of the learner'sdecisions in previous periods, which will allow the learner move forward intime with wrong answers. This will achieve our goal of giving the learners\"more rope\" and letting them see the results of their mistakes. In order toThe feedback will be fairly high-level, as we discussed in Thursday'smeeting. We will be able to provide feedback on cumulative P&L andpositions, but not about specific actions the learner took in a previousperiod. We will not, for example, be able to say things like \"InNovember, when we were headed into a cold winter, you chose to withdrawgas. What you should have done was...\"We cannot save the P&L and position numbers. This means that if thelearner leaves the simulation, returns to the main menu, or experiencesa computer crash, his decisions will not be saved and he will need tostart over at time period one.We cannot have the learner calculate P&L on storage costs,transportation costs, or hedging instruments. This is because the rightanswer and the available answer choices would have to depend on thedecisions the learner has made. Now that the learner can go down anypath he chooses, the number of possible answers is extremely large, andthe right answers are variable. I believe these tasks will be actuallybetter if we don't have the learner calculate P&L because he has alreadycalculated P&L numerous times in the structurer/customer scenarios andconversion and arbitrage scenarios. Furthermore, the type of feedback wewould have to give about specific P&L numbers will not flow well withthe high-level, global-type feedback we are now planning to give in thistask.We cannot export price numbers into Excel because the Indeliq frameworkdoes not support the downloading of data into external applications. Thetechnical effort required to add this functionality far exceeds our currentdevelopment budget. We can, however, do some calculations for the learneron the screen. We can also try to somehow allow the learner to make themistake of using future prices instead of discounted prices.If you could please respond with your approval or concerns by end of dayWednesday, it will allow us to move forward with the development of thissimulation.

We arecurrently offering live online auctioning capabilities, online virtualdatarooms and certain deal areas for the syndication of bank products andlease portfolios.  We have completed transactions with nominal value of over$4 Billion since launching the site 4 months ago.

  "Investment Structure": [
    "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><clclegal2@aol.com>Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Callwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.Sincerely,George RichardsPresident, Creekside Builders, LLC- winmail.dat"

  "Italian inflation's decline continues": [
    "Italian inflation's decline continuesCity CPI (November)Italian inflation continues its steady downward trend. This will go on.Producer prices inflation is falling even faster than CPI inflation.Moreover, wages remain muted, increasing slower than inflation this year.With the ongoing weakness of domestic demand all ingredients are thus inplace for further fall in inflation.* Based on the city CPI, we see Italian prices up 0.2% in November(possibly only 0.1%), and inflation is likely to lose a further decimalpoint at 2.4% (possibly 2.3%). If confirmed, this would be the seventhconsecutive fall in inflation and the lowest level of reached since April2001.* We see inflation down in the coming months. The decline in domesticdemand will create more spare capacity, and the fall in commodity priceswill also help. Underlying pressures should thus unwind helping coreinflation down.* The breakdown suggest that the transportation sector register a largefall in prices. This is the direct effect of falling oil prices. Despitethe removal of the tax credit on fuel, gasoline prices have indeeddeclined. Data also provide some evidence that food prices are alsoreceding to a more normal level.St?phane D?oEconomic ResearchUBS WarburgStephane.deo@ubsw.com"

  "Italy flirting with recession": [
    "Italy flirting with recessionGDP, flash estimate ?(Q3)Despite a positive help from calendar effects, Italian GDP growth remainedat a low 0.1% qoq in Q3. This suggests that, without calendar effects GDPeconomy was thus very close to recession. Although details are notavailable we believe the weakness of domestic demand and a drag from nettrade are the reasons for this weak outcome. We expect similar low numbersin the coming quarters.* The Italian flash estimate showed a slightly higher than expect growth at0.2%. It does not provide however a breakdown, details will be availablewith the publication of the final numbers on Dec-20. At this stage, it isthus impossible to assess the drivers of Italian growth.* It is important to remember that, unlike in the other countries, ItalianGDP is not adjusted for calendar effects. In Q3 there was two working daysmore than in Q2 (64 working days against 62). This probably helped to liftslightly the GDP estimate.* Italian GDP gained 0.8% for two quarters in a row in 00Q4 and 01Q1.Details however showed that this was due exclusively to net trade andstocks. Final domestic demand which includes private consumption,investment and public consumption gained only 0.3%qoq on average over thesetwo quarters. This weak pattern was confirmed in Q2 with GDP flat qoq andfinal domestic demand up only 0.3%.* This pattern is quite worrying as we expect net trade to contributenegatively to growth in the future. Italy will have to rely exclusively ondomestic demand. ISTAT said that it expected Q4 growth to be 0.1-0.2% inQ4. We are more pessimistic as we expect a contraction of 0.1%.St?phane D?oEconomic ResearchUBS WarburgStephane.deo@ubsw.com"

INVESTMENT IDEASThe decade ahead for e-businessSell-side solutions may be the wave of the near-term futureBy Steve Butler, senior analyst, eMarketerAt the Line56 conference held recently in New York, one of themost upbeat perspectives on the future of e-business came fromTom Thomas, current CEO and chairman of Haht Commerce, andformer CIO of Dell Computer (DELL) during the 1990s.Taking the long-term view of e-business over the next decade,Thomas compared the current economic climate in 2001 to that of1991--a time when the United States was in the middle of arecession, but at the beginning of a decade when the deploymentof new technologies would bring immense opportunity for growth.Click here to read more.2. INVESTMENT IDEASBroadband goes mainstreamThat sound you hear may be media finally streaming and screamingthrough fat pipesBy Dave Sterman, equity research columnistWho needs a race car when the local speed limits are 10 miles per hour?That was the lesson learned by many Internet-oriented business modelsthat delivered services geared towards high-speed access, only to findthat most surfers were still connected to the Web by a dowdy 56K dial-up modem. The promise of (high-speed) broadband connections has beenso slow to materialize that many start-ups ran out of cash before evergarnering a large audience. Entire sectors, such as Web-based animation,have come and gone.But just as the hype has cooled, it now looks like the promise ofbroadband may finally be realized as we head into 2002. Penetrationrates are rising again, and could soon reach the critical mass necessary tomake broadband a mainstream technology. Roughly 10.7 million U.S.households now have broadband access, representing about 16 percent ofall households online, according to research firm the Yankee Group.That's up some 60 percent from 12 months ago.Click here to read more.WORD FROM OUR SPONSOR--------------------------New Enhancements to Traditional and Roth IRAsThe 2001 Tax Act included several enhancements to individualretirement accounts.

Free High-Speed Wireless Net Access?8. More Trouble for DSL9.

Discipline above all else!Now that technological advances and the globalization of the economy haveassured virtual teaming a place of permanence in today's business world, thetask at hand is to make this brand of teamwork as effective as possible.Authors Jon Katzenbach and Douglas Smith emphasize discipline as the key tovirtual team success. This article outlines a number of helpful suggestionsfrom their latest book, \"The Discipline of Teams,\" including establishingclear goals, setting measurable objectives, and agreeing upon specific workrules.2. Officing Alternatives Getting a Second Look in the Aftermath\"Necessity is the mother of invention.\" It may also be the mother ofacceptance-prompting people who might otherwise disregard the new or thedifferent to give it a try when there are few other alternatives. WhileTelework and other Alternative Office concepts are not new by any means, manyemployers and employees alike, affected by world-changing events like theterrible tragedies of September 11th are looking for creative strategies toget people back to work until they can get back to their offices.3. Should Employees Pay to Work from Home?For employers who make the commitment to develop and deploy a Teleworkprogram for their employees, the costs associated with adequately equippingremote workers may be slightly higher than for their in-office counterparts.However, in contrast to the costs of providing office space, these expensesare truly insignificant. This article is an example of how Siemen's decidedto disburse home office allowances.4.  Think GlobalIn Fortune Magazine's Sept. 3rd Edition, IDRC presented an in-depth look atthe value of an \"integrated workplace\"; one that supports technology,services and people, in a changing economy. Check out this feature to learnmore, and to see results from Kinetic Workplace's State of the Industrysurvey.--------------DESIGNAs politicians continue the battle over federal ergonomic regulations in theworkplace, scientists are waging their own fight over the cause of therepetitive stress injuries (RSI), whose incidence such regulations are aimedat reducing. Some researchers argue that, contrary to popular belief, thereis not a link between heavy computer use and RSI, particularly carpal tunnelsyndrome. Other researchers point to a large body of research documentingsuch a link. This article reviews evidence on both sides of the issue.6.  Is \"Big Brother\" such a bad thing when it comes to home safety?While many companies that allow telework focus on the safety and security oftheir networks and data, the issue of the worker's physical safety in thehome office is often overlooked. The lines of responsibility are not clear,leaving workers uncertain about what they need to do and companies fearful ofbeing perceived as being \"Big Brother\" if they intrude too much into theirworker's homes.Jeff Zbar points out the need to ensure that your Home Office is safe andsecure, and provides a security check list for the home office, and a shortquestionnaire to test your home office's security and safety. These threearticles underscore the need for teleworkers to have a formalized policy thatclearly outlines both their and their employer's responsibilities inproviding a safe and secure home office. Addressing these issues up front andin writing eliminates any uncertainty.--------------TECHNOLOGY7. Free High-Speed Wireless Net Access?With the demise of Ricochet, the high-speed wireless access carrier, somebandwidth junkies have turned to free wireless networks. These \"freenets\" areset up by users via the Wi-Fi standard and cable or DSL modem sharing. Cablecarriers call them illegal, while users say it's a solution to the last mileproblem.8. More Trouble for DSLWith the demise of several providers, the DSL equipment market is shrinking,pushing users towards lower cost cable modems provided by more stablecompanies. This may impact which DSL equipment provider you choose for yourremote access solution, as there may be other vendors exiting the marketshould the downturn continue.9. Tech talk for your home officeThis article takes a look at the types of technologies companies areproviding their teleworkers in order to create a high tech office at home.Check out this article for the cost implications of outfitting home officesand discover some of the pros and cons of tools, dial-up services andsecurity solutions.----------------UNSUBSCRIBEWe hope you enjoyed receiving this newsletter and found the content valuable,but if you would rather not receive Kinetic Clippings, please FORWARD thisentire email to remove@mailzilla.net and you will automatically be removedfrom the list.----------------ABOUT KINETIC CLIPPINGSThis newsletter provides links to articles and resources we believe will helpyou as you implement any new workplace strategy.

Investment bankers pride themselves on makingvast amounts of money, but a successful private equity professional takesdevilish pride and supports an even bigger ego for working fewer hours whilemaking even more money than his (rarely her) investment banking brethren.Unfortunately, some members of the private equity community mistakenlybelieve that their growing wealth is the result of their own talent andcharming personality rather than a simple profiting from the hoarding ofcapital, as Karl Marx so astutely described.Consider the plight of Peter Chung (see attached email), a recent hire atthe Carlyle Group.  After completing his two-year stint as an Analyst atMerrill Lynch, Chung was persuaded to seek out new opportunities in Koreaworking as part of Carlyle's vast Asian investment team.  Working at aprivate equity firm allows Chung to check out Korean night clubs (whichwould be legally classified as brothels in the United States) 3-4 times aweek, though Chung made it clear that he needs only two months to \"learn alittle bit of the buyside business\" so he can begin nightly visits.  Alreadya self-described \"stud\" on the New York City dating scene, Chung looked tothe emerging island of Korea where the standard of living for young foreignmen is bolstered by the low per capita income of native residents (roughly$12,600 per person).  By making in excess of ten times the average nationalwage, Chung quickly found himself to be quite the ladies man as the localswere attracted to his fat wallet and U.S. citizenship.  Thus bolstered by aninitial rendezvous or two, Chung decided to cement his legacy by setting outon the quixotic mission to sleep with all of the fine women of Korea.As of May 15, 2001, Chung alludes to having had sexual relations with five\"hot chicks.\"  According to Chung's own calculations, there are roughly onebillion \"hot chicks\" remaining in Korea.  Clearly there is a break inChung's sexual predator model as he apparently believes that not only is theglobal female population of 3 billion comprised of 1/3 hot Korean chicks,but he will be able to sleep with that many before his finest member fallsoff or he dies of exhaustion.  Sadly, Chung cannot complete his missionalone.  The quality of prophylactics in Korea are not quite up to U.S.standards (Chung would probably claim Korean condoms are too small) and heneeds your help to continue his quest for infamy.  If you would like tocontribute to this valiant mission, please direct your gift of aPeter ChungThe Carlyle GroupSuite 1009, CCMM Bldg.12, Yoido-dong, Youngdeungpo-kuSeoul 150-010, KoreaChung asks that you consider using FedEx or another international overnightcourier since he may be on the verge of running out of protection.Alternatively, if you would like to pursue a job working for The CarlyleThe Honorable James A.

Since leaving the White House, Jim Baker has continued hisinternational mission to spread goodwill and STDs throughout the world bysupporting young Romeos such as Mr. Chung.For a first-hand account of life in private equity, please read PeterChung's travelogue (attached).  Please keep in mind that Chung's experienceis partially a function of his prior status as a \"stud\" and may not bereflective of private equity experiences in general.  Not all of us can hopeto be as smart, debonair and modest as Mr. Chung.Regards,Justin--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<james_graff@rsco.com>,\"'lgreer@ivisionary.com'\"<lgreer@ivisionary.com>,\"'matt.harty@goldpocket.com'\"<matt.harty@goldpocket.com>,\"'kevin_matto@rsco.com'\"<kevin_matto@rsco.com>,\"'wrobertson@exchange.ml.com'\"<wrobertson@exchange.ml.com>,\"'pstanberry@onebox.com'\"<pstanberry@onebox.com>,\"'shiv.vasisht@ubsw.com'\"<shiv.vasisht@ubsw.com>,\"'johnmin@microsoft.com'\"<johnmin@microsoft.com>,\"'brandon.park@csfb.com'\"<brandon.park@csfb.com>,\"'jose.park@webvision.com'\"<jose.park@webvision.com>,\"'kevin.woo@avenuea.com'\" <kevin.woo@avenuea.com>So I've been in Korea for about a week and a half now and what can I say,LIFE IS GOOD....I've got a spanking brand new 2000 sq. foot 3 bedroom apt. with a 200 sq.foot terrace running the entire length of my apartment with a viewoverlooking Korea's main river and nightline......Why do I need 3 bedrooms?Good question,.... the main bedroom is for my queen size bed,...where CHUNGis going to fuck every hot chick in Korea over the next 2 years (5 down,1,000,000,000 left to go).... the second bedroom is for my harem ofchickies, and the third bedroom is for all of you fuckers when you come outto visit my ass in Korea.

I knowI was a stud in NYC but I pretty much get about, on average, 5-8 phonenumbers a night and at least 3 hot chicks that say that they want to gohome with me every night I go out.

  "LNG on the road": [
    "The short answer is that trucking LNG to California is not a feasible optionfor endusers other than companies with LNG-fueled vehicle fleets. There are acouple of reasons for this.First, California has a relative abundance of LNG fueling stations but onlytwo plants capable of regasification. One serves Borrego Springs, a small,affluent desert community near San Diego. The other is dedicated to militaryand industrial supply near Sacramento. I spoke this morning to Applied LNGTechnologies, which is based in Amarillo and has the second largest LNG truckfleet (after Transgas in Massachusetts). It shouldn't be a surprise that Iwas not the first to call regarding this question. While ALT's fleet isoperating at capacity - trucking LNG from liquefaction plants in Wyoming andTopock, Arizona - it's serving its normal fleet customers in SouthernCalifornia and Nevada, and Arizona. The Topock, AZ plant is owned jointly byALT and El Paso, and receives gas from El Paso for liquefaction andsubsequent loading onto trucks.Second, LNG trucks, unlike LNG tankers, carry an extremely small volume. Theaverage truck carries 10,000 gallons of LNG, which translates roughly into820,000 cubic feet. ALT has about 23 vehicles so potentially one coulddeliver 18.8 mmcf. However, these trucks don't regasify LNG, they merelytransfer it into storage.The only really viable option for putting gas into the pipeline system wouldbe a portable pipeline unit, of which ALT has the only one (it's underrepair). It can deliver high pressure gas at 1800 cubic feet/minute (2.6mmcf/day if it runs 24 hours). It has connections for two LNG trucks at atime - one live and one backup, so it can operate continuously. In the past,ALT has used the unit to cover industrials who had a supply outage for somereason.I'm going to continue gathering info on domestic LNG peakshaving plants, etc.I think the opportunity may lie more in future, more strategically locatedpeakshaving plants rather than LNG trucking arbitrage.Please let me know if you have specific questions."
  ],
  "LNG to California": [
    "John,Following up on yesterday, there are two additional considerations.First, with regard to the idea of curtailing gas input at the Topockliquefaction plant, the pipeline bottleneck is actually downstream of theplant, so that wouldn't help.Second, it seems there are more of these \"portable pipeline\" units floatingaround than I thought. Besides the inoperable unit in Amarillo, both Transgas(in Massachusetts) and Minnigasco may have at least one. Moreover, PG&E hasone at the end of a long lateral line on its system just south of Sacramento.Apparently it uses it mostly to augment linepack. The specs of that unit arefeet/hour (about 9.6 mmcf/d or almost one contract) at 150 psi. As I saidyesterday, these units are the only way that you could get gas into thepipeline system in California.This information I got from Jeff Beale, who runs CH-IV, a small-scale LNGconsultant. He said that he'd had some similar calls about LNG, and also thathe'd be willing to help Enron source equipment if we were really interestedin looking further into transporting LNG into California.Assuming that we could get a few \"portable pipelines\" and some trucks, thereLocation Owner  Liquefaction Capacity (gal/day)  Capacity (mmcf/d) Storage(gal) Storage (mmcf)Topock, AZ ElPaso/ALT 90,000      7.4   100,000  8.2LaPlata, CO Williams 20,000     1.64   100,000  8.2Sacramento   57,600     4.72   132,000  10.8LaBarge, WY Exxon  60,000     4.92Evanston, WY Amoco  95,000     7.8   100,000  8.2Totals         26.48Whether these plants have spare LNG to sell us is another question. TheSacramento plant, which I mentioned yesterday, is supposedly dedicated toproviding methane for laboratory purposes. The others may have contracts withLNG fleet owners.I'll check back with you later today about the outcome of your meeting."

    "Hi NikThis is the nasty side of American business.  There is nothing to be embarassed or discouraged about.  These are hard times and I think your graduation timing is no help either.  People graduating '98 through '00 had it goood.  But hang in there, opportunities are fewer, but they are out there.  You might want to broaden your search into energy and healthcare.Enron is one heck of a story. What a ride !  The only conclusion I have is, next time I see some professor about efficient stock markets, I am going to smack him bad. As hard it is to manage businesses in trouble, it is not easy to manage businesses which are over-valued either. There is huge propensity for management to be complacent and attribute it to themselves, while it might be the investors folly and nothing more.  I have been on the ride up and down and all I can say is you live and you learn.I will look out for opportunities out here. Enron is trying to stay close to core businesses but the energy industry in general is still hiring and complacent. You keep at it bud, and things are going to get better.  This market economy beast can be hard to handle at times but in the end it works out. Say hi to Cindy and Noah.Harry-----Original Message-----I am kind of embarassed to write this mail to you but just wanted to let you know that I was laid off by my firm last week. Although I am really mad at the way I was treated, I am ready to move on. I am not too sure as to what I am going to do as jobs here in this country are pretty rare these days. But we have planned to stay in Boston for a month and failing which we will move with my sister in NJ and stay there for a couple of months and if nothing works out we will go back to Vancouver. Although I am not too sure what I am going to do in Vancouver.But I thought I should share this with you and in case you have any opportunities for people with my skills in mind you can let me know. I know Enron itself has been going through some shaky times at the moment. It seems that suddenly bad news is raining from all directions or pouring is perhaps a right word to describe it.Bye for now and keep in touch.Harnek"

NOUNINSTRUCTED DEVIATIONS WILL BE ALLOWED.  Section 2.3.1.2.1 of the ISOTariff requires Market Participants in the ISO Control Area to \"comply fullyand promptly with the ISO's operating orders.\" Any Generating Unit with realtime output that reflects an excessive deviation from the real time outputconsistent with its Final Hour Ahead Schedule as adjusted by Dispatchinstructions, and assuming a 20 minute ramp across the top of the hour forhourly Schedule changes, will be deemed to have failed to comply with thisoperating order.  For the purpose of this determination, an excessivedeviation shall be the smaller of 10% of a Generating Unit's maximumcapability, or 10 MW.  The only exception to this finding is a GeneratingUnit that provides the ISO with timely notification of a unit outage orderate. Failure to comply with this operating order threatens the reliableoperation of the ISO Control Area.  In particular, uninstructed incrementaldeviations by Generating Units that are \"chasing\" the BEEP Interval Pricespublished by the ISO are directly responsible for the frequency excursionsthe ISO experienced  June 13, 2000. The ISO will take the following actionswith respect to those Generating Units that fail to comply with thisGoverning Board that provides a copy of this notice, and a comparison of theinstructed and actual output profile for each Generating Unit that fails tocomply. 2) The ISO will assign any WSCC RMS penalties associated withfrequency deviations to the Generating Units that fail to comply."

  "Market Opinion about AGA's": [
    "Interesting observation...but I'm not sure I agree.   I think consensusopinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering thewinter.  A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injectionseason with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground. With the most recent AGA, thoseprojections seem to be closer to 2.7.  With supply of gas very inelastic toprice in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of theequation.  The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand(mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplieswill be stored rather than burned.  Each AGA number is another data point asto whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach acomfortable level in storage entering the winter.   A low AGA numberindicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up.Certainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number  may bea function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reportingnoise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demandequilibrium.  We'll know a lot more as the next two weeks' numbers come out.If we get two low injections, watch out.Enron North America Corp.John,I think the AGA's are not as important to bulls as to bears.  In thebeginning of the season, AGA's were  very important in framing the bullcase.  The current expectation is that we will go into the winter understored.  I don't believe any additional AGA news can significantly changethat expectation.However, I believe Bears, as evidenced today, will feed more heavily off ofbearish AGA news, than bulls will off bullish AGA news.At this juncture, I believe that the most potent bullish news has to comefrom the physical market and weather.I hope you don't mind me expressing my view point on this issue.Thanks,Frank"

In attendance were Ken Lay,the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov.spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and hisideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of nextweek as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based onmy discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials JeffDasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding ourproposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situationwe are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoingcommunication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities togo bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than whatthe utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has morework to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  Hetalked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retaillevel.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for thebenefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which hewould dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market orientedsolutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fixthe problem by '02 and provide some political cover.included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemedinterested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting agoal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilitiesto gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rateanalysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issuesincluding designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gaspurchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to findingsome state sponsored credit support for the utilities.under serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".Some of these ideas would require legislative action.State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" ofgeneration plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers thatthey are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  Thiswas a frequently recurring theme.Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plusbasis to consumers.Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation inCalifornia.State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would morewidely deploy distributed generation.Expand in-state gas production.Take state lands gas royalties in kind.negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west foraddtional gas supplies.Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plantmaintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service atany one time.Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hearmore about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should beable to help out here).Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We madesome headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buysome portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generationthereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and controlapproach with generators.Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.thoughts and get them to Kari)He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --not just the 5 one year strips.He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of thedeal.He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of theforward contracting issues.Thanks to everyone for their help.

  "Message from Ken Lay": [
    "Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.Ken Lay"

  "Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective": [
    "Friday, December 28, 2001All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.Parking & Transportation Desk3-7060"

It looks like he will also feel out theorganizational structure to see if his contacts are the right ones.ColleenMichael Horning@ENRON COMMUNICATIONSColleen,As part of my strategy, I want to glean information.    Hopefully it willgive me an understanding of their process and goals, so that I may be moreeffective in my discussions with their media group.Following are a few questions I will ask Daphne (I don't expect Daphne to1) Help me understand how Universal wants to save money on advertising?2) Who at Universal is driving that process?

    "thx  and have fun on vacaSorry I didn't get to come by before I left. I have been in London since12/15.I hope the expiry goes smoothly for you. Also I hope your hollidayseason is going well ( however abridged it is by the NYMEX and Enron)Many of the guys over here asked about nat gas and EOL in the US. Isuggested they visit with you when they are over in the US. In particular,Chris Mahoney (gasoil trader) will be in Houston the 27 t0 30. I told him heshould come and watch you deal with the AGA number and NX1 at the same time.Chris is a really good guy. His team loves him and will definitely play alarge role in turning the crude and products group around.Anyway you were a great pal over the last 12 months and gave me a lot ofgood advice. I do miss listening to the banter on the gas floor (and thegambling!), but there are a lot of good people in crude and products(especially in London) and I think we will be able to deliver on the goods.

Revenues from continuing operations were US$3.69 billion fo=r the third quarter of 2001 compared to US$6.73 billion in the same period =in 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for the third qua=rter of 2001, excluding incremental provisions and other charges, was US$85=4 million or US$0.27 per common share. Including the incremental provisions=and other charges, pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for th=e third quarter of 2001 was US$2.18 billion, or US$0.68 per common share, c=ompared to pro forma net earnings of US$597 million, or US$0.19 per common =share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2000.   In the quarter, in=cremental charges included in the pro forma net loss from continuing operat=inventory, primarily related to Optical Inter-City; US$767 million (pre-ta=x) for increased provisions related to trade receivables and customer finan=cing; and US$380 million (pre-tax) primarily related to charges associated =illion (pre-tax) charge for restructuring associated with the completion of=the workforce reductions and facilities closures announced in June 2001; a=nd a US$223 million (pre-tax) charge primarily related to the approximately=50 percent reduction in manufacturing capacity of its Photonics Components=business.   Including Acquisition Related Costs(a), stock option compensat=ion from acquisitions and divestitures, and one-time gains and charges, Nor=tel Networks recorded a net loss from continuing operations in the third qu=arter of 2001 of US$3.47 billion or US$1.08 per common share.   \"Revenues f=or the quarter reflected the challenges presented as the telecom industry a=djusted to new levels of spending,\" said John Roth, president and chief exe=cutive officer Nortel Networks. \"Our bottom line results reflected the impa=ct of actions we have taken to adjust to the new business levels. During th=e third quarter of 2001, Nortel Networks continued to aggressively implemen=t its work plan to reduce its cost structure and streamline operations. The=Company is in the final stages of implementing a cost structure to drive b=reak even at a quarterly revenue level well below US$4 billion. The structu=re is expected to be in place in the first quarter of 2002.\"   Frank Dunn, =the Company's new president and chief executive officer effective November =1, 2001, said, \"Nortel Networks is focusing its investments and its organiz=, which encompasses metro optical networking, IP networking, IP services an=d voice over IP solutions for service providers and enterprises; Wireless N=etworks; and Optical Long Haul Networks. In the quarter, our product progra=ms continued to advance as we focused on building on our industry-leading p=ortfolio of solutions. We also continued to work with our customers to help=them plan and deploy the solutions that will position them to drive reduct=ions in their cost of operations and enable them to take advantage of oppor=tunities for new revenue streams. Some key milestones over the past 120 day=packet         transition with the deployment of our carrier-grade         =softswitch;     --  Announced Metro DWDM wins in the United States, Europe =and         Japan;     --  Announced Multiservice backbone awards (ATM, IP,=MPLS) in         China, Germany and Asia;     --  Continued progress on 3G=Wireless Internet infrastructure         deployments and completed the fir=st commercial UMTS test calls         and the first CDMA2000 1X mobile IP c=all;     --  Introduced advances in IP solutions, including an integrated  =Layer 4-7 content switching capability on our Layer 2-3 Edge        =Switch Router; and     --  Completed hardware design, significantly advanc=ed software         integration and began production of OPTera Connect HDX =solution.\"    As announced on October 2, 2001, the Company expects =to have an overall workforce of approximately 45,000 after the completion o=f its work plan. Notifications to employees impacted by workforce reduction=s are expected to be substantially completed by the end of October 2001. A =workforce reduction and related charge will be recorded in the fourth quart=er of 2001. Over the next few quarters, the Company also expects to continu=e to divest non-core businesses in accordance with its work plan. The numbe=r of positions which will be impacted by this divesture activity (including=the impact of divestures announced or completed to date) is expected to ul=timately approach 10,000 positions.   Commenting on cash management in the =quarter, Frank Dunn said, \"We are extremely pleased with the results that h=ave been generated from our focus on cash management, which drove a signifi=cant improvement in cash and contributed to positive cashflow from operatio=ns. In addition, the Company further increased its financial flexibility by=completing a highly successful US$1.8 billion convertible debt issue which=, combined with positive operating cash performance from continuing operati=ons and a significant reduction in short term debt, has significantly enhan=ced our strong liquidity position. Given the industry correction and action=s we have taken over the last two quarters, Nortel Networks balance sheet i=s well positioned.\"   \"While we believe we are beginning to see early indic=ations that capital spending by service providers is approaching sustainabl=e levels, it still remains difficult to predict. In light of this and the u=ncertainty regarding the potential impacts of events taking place in the wa=ke of the September 11, 2001 tragedies and their effect on economies and bu=sinesses around the world, we are not providing guidance for the fourth qua=rter of 2001 or the full year 2002 at this time,\" concluded Dunn.         R=evenue Breakdown from Continuing Operations    Network Infrastructure reven=ues decreased 48 percent in the third quarter of 2001 compared to the third=quarter of 2000. Wireless Internet solutions grew substantially in Canada =and slightly in Asia, which was more than offset by a considerable decline =in Latin America, a slight decline in the United States and a decline in Eu=rope. Optical Inter-city revenues were down sharply in the United States, E=urope and Latin America, minimally offset by growth in Asia. Local Internet=revenues were down substantially in the United States, Europe, Canada and =Latin America, which were minimally offset by an increase in Asia.   Photon=ic Components segment revenues were down 93 percent in the third quarter co=mpared to the same period last year. The sharp decline in the segment was l=argely due to considerably lower sales of Nortel Networks Optical Inter-cit=y solutions compared to the third quarter of 2000.   Other revenues decline=d 29 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Su=bstantial growth in Global Professional Services in Europe and Asia, and st=rong growth in the United States, was more than offset by considerable decl=ines in legacy voice solutions for corporations across all regions and wire=less OEM revenues in most regions.   Commensurate with its announcement on =October 2, 2001 to align its resources around three businesses (Metro Netwo=rks, Wireless Networks and Optical Long Haul Networks), Nortel Networks wil=l evolve its financial reporting to reflect the new organization beginning =in the fourth quarter of 2001.   Geographic revenues for the third quarter =of 2001 compared to the same period in 2000 decreased 54 percent in the Uni=ted States, 53 percent in Canada and 30 percent outside the United States a=nd Canada.         Nine-Month Results    For the first nine months of 2001,=revenues from continuing operations were US$14.06 billion compared to US$1=9.75 billion for the same period in 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuin=g operations(a) for the first nine months of 2001 was US$4.01 billion, or U=S$1.26 per common share, compared to pro forma net earnings of US$1.57 bill=ion, or US$0.51 per common share on a diluted basis, for the same period in=2000. Including the net loss from discontinued access solutions operations=, Acquisition Related Costs(a), stock option compensation from acquisitions=and divestitures, one-time gains and charges, and the write down of intang=ible assets, Nortel Networks recorded a net loss of US$25.48 billion, or US=$8.01 per common share, for the first nine months of 2001.         Spending=Management    The Company continued to make rapid progress to reduce its c=ost structure. Compared to the Company's year-end 2000 cost structure, excl=usive of incremental provisions and charges, the Company's cost structure a=t the end of the third quarter of 2001 is lower by approximately US$1 billi=on.         Gross Margin    Gross margin for the third quarter of 2001 was =approximately 1 percent reflecting incremental charges of approximately US$=750 million related to excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the exp=ected decrease in sales due to the continued downturn in the market. Exclud=ing the impact of these incremental and other contract-related charges, gro=ss margin for the third quarter of 2001 was approximately 25 percent, compa=red to approximately 26 percent in the second quarter of 2001.         Expe=nses    Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses in the third =quarter of 2001 were US$1.92 billion. The continued impact of the market ad=justments and further decline in some of our of customers' financial condit=ion resulted in incremental provisions of US$767 million in the quarter rel=ated to customer receivables and financings. Excluding the incremental prov=isions in both periods, SG?expenses in the third quarter of 2001, compared =to second quarter of 2001, were down by approximately US$190 million.   Res=earch and development (\"R&D\") expenses were US$808 million in the third qua=rter of 2001. The R?expenses in the quarter reflected focused investments t=o drive continued market leadership in our core businesses and the eliminat=ion of spending in all other areas. Compared to the second quarter of 2001,=R? expenses in the third quarter of 2001 were down by approximately US$100=million, reflecting the impact of restructuring and streamlining operation=s.   The financial results of Nortel Networks Limited(b) (\"NNL\"), Nortel Ne=tworks Corporation's principal operating subsidiary, are fully consolidated=into Nortel Networks results. NNL has preferred shares which are publicly =traded in Canada. For the third quarter of 2001, NNL took a restructuring c=harge of US$793 million (pre-tax) associated with the completion of workfor=ce reductions and the closure of certain facilities related to business str=eamlining; and recorded US$207 million (pre-tax) primarily related to the a=pproximately 50 percent reduction in manufacturing capacity of the Photonic=s Components business.

    "We are still on for drinks on the 19th.  You have called the market very wellsince you started sending me updates.  Unfortunately for both of us, a coupleof good calls does not a soothsayer make.  Thus, keep sending me your updatesso I can at least get a little broader judgment of your abilities.   In termsof my trading style, I take positions to make $.25-$1, not $.05.  Too muchnoise in this market to trade differently for me.I hope you know I was just fishing for a reaction on the phone before.  Iassumed we would discuss a potential relationship when I'm in Houston on the19th.  We're still on for drinks after work, right?  By then, you shouldhave a comfort level with the quality of my work.  I think the analysis I'vegiven you has been quite accurate as to market turns and price behavior.  Itwould be helpful if I had some idea of how you trade/view the market.  Areyou mainly day-trading or do you hold positions for several days/weeks?That way I can structure my comments in order to best serve your interests.Let me know.  Thanks,----- Original Message -----Let's keep the present system for the short-term.  I would like to continuelooking at your work for another couple weeks.  We'll talk later,JohnThe price behavior of the past couple days has been  disappointing. Myshort-term market patterns suggested a more robust price  rally and naturalappears to be waning at present. Volume on this rally is  poor,particularly since yesterday was a decent day to the upside. The  marketappears to be using a lot of its energy but spinning its wheels. If  weare at these same price levels in another two weeks, that would beextremely  bullish. Right here, the risk/reward to being long is not sogreat.   Recommend a neutral stance short-term on natural. Bigger pictureis still  very bullish. However, this market needs another 1-2 weeks ofwhat I would  call horizontal price action to set the stage for a big moveto the  upside.Let me know if this stuff is useful for you. I certainly  don't want towaste your time. In addition, if you prefer I call when I  have somethingto pass along, let me know. I don't know how often you  check/see youre-mail. Thanks,Mark Sagel"

It is very draft in nature but I wanted to get the working version over to you ASAP.  I wanted to get this discussion going via written format so that I (or others who may implement this) can stay focused on what you want and not get into broader research, etc....I think I can put a model together if we can define what parameters, the interface (levers) and model (transfer functions) to use that would be useful for you as phase I product.I will fire off updates to this document as I make them.  If you have a spec doc or ideas that you want to hand write on a print out, please do so and I will update the document.I will like to make sure that I am on the same page before beginning to code the program and to start linking to additional moths (month 2, 3, ..) and different curves, etc.My Job search has gone well with the Crude desk and I am waiting compensation indication from them to make my decision. Also, Kevin Presto feels that I could potentially help his power group with new market or spread trading.  John Suarez is a director who came from the power desk to EBS is going back to work for Kevin Presto.

The work that Dave Forster did was just for front month.  That creates month 1.  Then, similar logic has to create a month 1/month 2 spread to create a month 2 outright market.   Same for month 2/ month 3 to create month 3.  There might be 24-36 individual markets to create a forward curve.  Sometimes month 1 has correlation to the month 1/ month 2 spread.  Sometimes it does not.

  "New curve generation methodology": [
    "I am changing the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 2004 to betterreplicate seasonal fundamentals.  There are convincing arguments as to whythe summer/winter spreads should tighten over time.  However, in the previousmethodology they blew out.  For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232while Cal 10 was .256.I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts thesummer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand monthsof July and August over time.The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup forJan  -.008Feb -.004Mar -.001Apr .002May .003Jun .004Jul .004Aug .004Sep .003Oct .002Nov -.003Dec -.006These premiums start in Jan 2004On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959,  the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the4/5 spread was marked at .0475.In the old methodologyJan 2003  = 2.959Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.9965Jan 2005  =          2.9965 + .0475 = 3.044In the new methodologyJan 2003  = 2.959Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 - .008 =2.9885Jan 2005  = 2.9885 + .0475 -.008 = 3.028Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year tabletoMonth x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on monthpremium tableThe seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when Ichange them"

    "-----Original Message-----Matt,Please stop doing trades without approval.  Please advise why this is so difficult for you.Thanks,Bill-----Original Message-----Matt,As we discussed several times previously, including earlier this week, Nine Energy Services LLC is a CREDIT WATCH COUNTERPARTY and a WMBE (Women and Minority owned Business Enterprises), which means that ALL trades need to be approved by Credit and documented with a Resale Agreement. Every time we transact, ENA's Confirmation Group needs to know from whom to expect payment, i.e. San Diego Gas & Electric. The nature of the transaction exposes ENA to secondary risk with the ultimate counterparty. On another note, some transactions COULD be declined by Credit due to direct exposure/risk that the ENA has with the Counterparty, outside of any WMBE Transactions.Sitara Deal Number 1014433 was another violation of Corporate Credit Policy. In the future, please contact Credit before transacting with any Credit Watch Counterparty.-Darren Vanek"

Ed said he would rather cause the position to be terminated (moving the approximately $40M MTM value out of the \"live\" status) than he would collect the $39M of outstanding invoices.  Ed's rationale is that any amounts settled (invoiced) will ultimately be collected in full w/ interest so there's no need to continue to wear the $40M MTM risk.Therefore, I will let our termination letter stand as issued and do not plan to contact Noble.ThanksLouis R.

INVESTMENT IDEASCharge!!!Consumers came to the rescue of retailers, and individual investorswill come to the rescue of the street.by Charles Payne, founder, chief executive officer and principal analyst, WallStreet StrategiesLast week saw a marked contrast to the previous week as the Northern Alliancewent from the Keystone Cops to a liberating rebel force, pushing the Talibanback on their heels (or on their toes, as they scatter to caves and tunnels inthe southern part of Afghanistan). Wall Street mavens and the media suggestedthat stocks were pushed higher by the war victories, and while I agree thatthe prospect of a short war is a positive element for the market, I believethat the week's success had some domestic ingredients as well. In fact, I thinkthe most telling moment of the week came when retail sales figures were releasedlast Wednesday, once again beating expectations.In the previous week, many observers were surprised to see that consumersentiment (as monitored by the Michigan survey) came in well above estimates,and was quickly dismissed as some type of fluke. After last week, though, Idont think anyone can question the resolve of the American consumer.WORD FROM OUR SPONSOR--------------------------Determine Your Net WorthKnowing your net worth gives you a picture of your financialcondition and helps you plan for the future and set investment goals.

Whether or not you want to invest in technow generally depends on how patient you are. If you're willing to get in early andwait until earnings recover and estimates get revised upward (something that willprobably be occurring around mid-2002), this is a great time to jump in.

INVESTMENT STRATEGIESStimulus is the key going forwardInvestors themselves, and not any single outside force, maygenerate a further market rally.By Charles Payne, founder, CEO, and principal analyst, Wall Street StrategiesWith Thanksgiving smack dab in the middle of the week, it was hard determiningwhat the market wanted to do or where investors' heads were at. After all, themarket seemed to be running on empty until the holiday-shortened Fridaysession, when the market zoomed. Of course, sticking with the engine analogy,nay-sayers will say that the market was just rolling downhill, benefiting from anabbreviated session that saw lighter-than-normal volume. I would agree thatFridays session wasnt an apples-to-apples comparison with regular sessions--itwas more like running a soapbox derby racer versus an open-wheel Indy-typecar that the market typically runs during a full session. According to those folksthat dont believe in the current market rally, Fridays results were amusing andeven entertaining, but of no enduring value.It would be easy to write the session off as a day-race that held little value in thegrand scheme of things, but that would be a big mistake. In the soapbox derby,gravity draws the homemade racers down a modest hill. The same could havehappened to stocks on Friday. Instead stocks climbed up that same modest hill.Stocks defied both gravity and the naysayers by trading higher and higher as theleft to its own devices, the market wants to rally higher. Sure, when there areearnings reports, economic data, brokerage downgrades, wars, unemployment,fear, and warnings from corporate America, the race becomes akin to handling ahigh-performance race car and turning corners at 180 miles an hour. It isnt aseasy as it looks.Click here to read more.2.

Nymex indicated that they would like to move ahead very quickly on getting a price posting arrangement with them on Access where they will be showing prices all day including the OTC products.  Once this is complete they would also like to contemplate an arrangement on a Phase 2 technology sale with them.  They are currently scoping our the Phase II requirements.Are we willing to post numbers on Access electronically and have the transaction occur on Access?  This will give us the risk of being double hit.Are we willing to dedicate technology resources to this effort (and away from other EnronOnline priorities) and will the desk get enough benefits to justify the opportunity costs?What would it take for you to post numbers in this fashion (fees, preferential fills, etc).  You have the original specialist proposal we sent to them.We indicated to Bo that we would get an answer on this and call in the next couple of days.  If we can answer these questions, Jay will have someone look at the Access code and determine the cost to us (development time).We will also be meeting with Nymex next Wed to talk about Phase II.  We think that we can structure a transaction that would include an Access Price Posting in the short term, Specialist role and an obligation to look at our Phase II proposal.

    "The EOL Reporting Database treats any distinct deal number as a separateunique deal.  An example would be a deal done with KUKUI Inc. on November8th, 2000.  It is booked as deal numbers Q86409.1, Q86409.2, Q86409.3, andQ86409.4.  These are four separate and unique deal numbers and thereforecount as a total of four deals.We understand that the trade desk may consider the deal in this example asjust one large deal with 4 different parts.  Unfortunately,  the EOLReporting Database has no way of telling whether or not these types of dealsare distinct different deals or part of one larger deal.  Since thiscurrently can not be known, the EOL Reporting Database uses the mostconservative approach and counts them all as individual deals.  This resultsin a higher OTC deal count and thus a lower EOL percentage of all deals.If you have any further questions , please don't hesitate to ask.Pete Berzinsx57597"

Would be happy to sit down and discuss more stuff with you if you are interested.Harry-----Original Message-----Hi Harry,I heard you speak yesterday at the originator's meeting.  It was rather interesting.  I took the Derivatives 2 course a few weeks ago and they went into the complexities of options trading.  It was cool stuff.  I'd like to know more about options trading and I hope that you can recommend some good sources or books.  I'd appreciate any info you could pass on.Also, I'm putting together an \"Originator's Toolkit\" which consists of the various financial products that the originators and mid marketers could offer to customers.  I'm attaching a list of option based products that I have put together so far.  I'd be grateful if you could take a minute, read through it, and let me know if there are any additional option products that I should include.  I want to make sure the toolkit has as many useful products as possible.Thanks so much,Max"

In contrast to the 1997 Black Label Cuvee, this wine is a little more compact, achieving the same riveting intensity, but at a lower finished alcohol. The result-- a concentrated, teeth-staining wine, with elegance. Parker has now put this wine on the map,and Babcock has taken it to even a higher level with this massive effort !

The 2000 version of this Dolcetto is a very explosive wine and an outstanding value. The dark fruit and complexity on both the finish and the mid-palate is very exciting. If you are looking for a wine to drink with a steak or lamb I couldn't think of a better combo than this. Have your own tasting notes?

This swap is at 4.70.. they are short 60 contracts..currently Cal02 is around $3.. which should result in $1M more positive P&L for Ospraie and $1M less for us.This must be settled first thing Monday.Caroline"

  "Overview of Investor Conference Call": [
    "Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=r imagined when we made these investments;-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=stand financial and operating disclosures; and-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=usly reported earnings.We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=Core BusinessesOur core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=.I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=mprovement in our counterparty relationships.Non-Core BusinessesOur non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=return from them has been dismal.We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.Businesses Under ReviewThese businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=ecomes available.Credit Rating/10-Q FilingWe continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=-- Moody's at Baa3       \"Under Review for Further Downgrade\"-- Fitch at BBB-             \"Evolving Status\"-- S&P at BBB-              \"CreditWatch Negative\"We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =19.We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =few days.

    "Jim,Your spreadsheet shows the same type of return I was calculating.  Your insurance and repair numbers seem very low.   Also, assuming that the options to extend at higher rates will be exercised is a huge leap of faith.  I don't believe these properties cost any where near the $150+/sf that they are being offered at.Based on the optimistic back loaded returns, I would not be comfortable purchasing a post office at this time.  Thank you anyway.Phillip-----Original Message-----Phillip,Hope you are doing well this week, and have great plans for Turkeyday!!We'll be with family in Austin, and kind of on a maiden voyage in our'83 Avion that we're upgrading for camping!Here's a look at three post offices in a slightly different manner.Remember that the Roma one is about 5 years old, was a 15 yr leaseoriginally. The other two are new.The Roma is like buying a savings account. It would be paid off in 10years, you would reap some cash flow during that period, then the bonuskicks in after that with the 10 yr. renewals at a higher lease incomeafter it's paid off. It would probably go beyond another 10 years. Cashon cash returns don't mean as much on shorter amoritazations like Roma.We have shown this info and flyers to several people, so do let us knowif you are interested in any of them...I really don't think they willlast long. With best regards, Jim Wills"

We are hoping to  supplement EMF's list of economists and economic modelers who are  largely academics or with government labs or offices with folks from companies  who can help shed some light on how companies anticipate markets  will react to climate policies and the possible changes to prices and  availability of cleaner fuels such as natural gas.  A description of the  2-day program follows, and we can provide more information on the EMF meeting as  well if that's helpful.  I would be grateful if you can help identify  someone at Enron -- or otherwise -- who you feel could both contribute  to and benefit from the discussions with top economists and modelers.    If you need more information, please feel  free to call me or Leianne Clements (our economist) at the Pew Center number  listed below.Thanks for considering,Vicki Arroyo CochranDirector of Policy AnalysisThe Economics of Natural Gas in the Climate Change  Debate (August 9-10, 2001)Determining future demands and supply of natural gas (NG)  are important in determining climate policies since burning NG is relatively  \"cleaner\" than burning coal and oil.   A climate policy based on reducing the carbon content in fuels would  favor NG, along with other less-carbon intensive energy sources, thus  accelerating its demand.    However, economic models looking at the climate change issue show mixed  results on this issue; many models show the demand for NG increasing relative to  more \"dirty\" fuels while others show its demand decreasing at a rate faster than  oil (explained by NG demand being more responsive to a tax).The Pew Center has found that NG information is often  extrapolated from that of oil.   Without clear information on the true path of the NG sector,  policy-makers will be misinformed on how to address the climate change  problem.  The Pew Center will host a  conference in conjunction with the Energy Modeling Forum of Stanford University,  to gather leading experts on both the modeling and practical side of determining  natural gas issues.  A report will  be published summarizing the topics discussed in the  conference.Pew Center on Global Climate Change2101 Wilson Blvd.Suite 550Arlington, VA 22201www.pewclimate.org- Chess.gif<Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>"

  "Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy": [
    "the market had to get to a price whereby these guys shut down.  there is justnot enough gas to allow everybody who wants to to burn it.  the elasticity ofdemand is in the industrial sector.  million dollar question is have wegotten to a high enough price whereby we end the year with gas in the groundand deliverability to meet a late cold snap.  shutdown of processing,distillate and resid switching, loss of industrial load...maybe we have.good holidays,johnPlants Shut Down and Sell the EnergyBy Peter BehrWashington Post Staff WriterThursday, December 21, 2000; Page E01Kaiser Aluminum Corp. had planned to spend December making aluminum at itsgiant smelters in the Pacific Northwest, run by electricity from theBonneville Power Administration's Columbia River dams. Then it saw a betterdeal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hittingunheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It isselling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what itpays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.energy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and evenoil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity ornatural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such largeindustrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But theyalso are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminumand fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt toconsumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.\"The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't knowwhat they're going to use to grow crops with,\" said David Wyss, chiefeconomist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increasedtheir warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills onan already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimatedthat gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for atypical U.S. household.That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higherenergy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expectedgrowth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annualrate in the first three months of next year. \"Overall, the recent energyprice developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economicslowdown,\" the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., inSioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which usenatural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, thecompany realized it would be much more profitable to stop production inDecember and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under itsexisting December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrativeofficer.\"We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' \" he said.Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, butRosenbury said it would be \"substantial.\"  In coming months, Terra's goodfortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and theprices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-evenpoint. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminatethe opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. \"If this persists,\"Rosenbury said, \"it's going to be a real problem.\"He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operatingnow. \"Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible thatfarmers will not have as much as they want,\" Rosenbury said. Royster-ClarkInc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer anddistributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning nextmonth. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justifycontinued production. \"We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able tobuy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,\" said PaulM. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. Acontinuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production andraise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions toplant feed corn, he said. \"It's sticker shock.\"According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gasremains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In thealuminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, theindustry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, ananalyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,and December's production will be lower still, he said. \"We'll get moreproduction cut announcements, I think,\" he said. A slowing in the U.S. andworld economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminumsupplies. \"But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly morethan the current forecast,\" he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open questionhow much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractuallyentitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonnevillefor $550 a megawatt hour for December.But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and futureprofits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund toBonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser andBonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect afternext October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveriesto Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. \"Outhere, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be anethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they liveup their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,\" Moseysaid., 2000 The Washington Post Company"

  "Please Reply by Wednesday, 8/22 -- Draft Rehearing Request -- FERC Reporting Requirements for California Sales": [
    "FERC Reporting Requirements for California SalesPlease add Mike Grigsby to the distribution list.-----Original Message-----Attached is a draft of our rehearing request on the order FERC issued in RM01-9 requiring sellers of gas into California to file information on their sales, transport, and purchases.  The rehearing request restates our arguments in response to the NOPR  that (1) permanent, formal reporting requirements are not appropriate to address a temporary problem and are beyond the scope of the Commission's powers under the Natural Gas Act and (2) the commission significantly underestimated the burden of the reporting requirements as well as the responding parties' ability to comply.  We also request that the reports, if they must be submitted, be due 45 days after the end of the month instead of the required 30 days.Please provide any comments or suggestions you may have on this draft to either myself (713-853-5840) or Leslie (505-623-6778) by COB Wednesday (8/22).Thanks."

While they look at the language, I will be getting a little ahead by building all the elements in our TEST database for the purpose of testing.  For your knowledge, the pieces that take the longest are legal review and testing.  However, on this particular product/product type, we will be building everything from scratch.  We are not typically faced with this requirement, but we will get it done as quickly as possible.  Let me know if you have questions.Kevin-----Original Message-----I wanted to be sure to touch base with you before the holidays.  I forwarded the Swaption to Brent Hendry last week.

  "Power Outage at Enron Building": [
    "Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.Enron Property & Services Corp"

  "Product Quotes and Software License Agreement (BMC / EBS info)": [
    "Jennifer and Peter, welcome back...!Attached are the notes from the EBS team and BMC organization regarding theproposals to EBS and Net Works (etc.) from BMC.I am curious, Peter (or Glenn), if it is reasonable of BMC to make thestatement to the effect that, \"...the 45% discount is applied only ifwe have the EBS Enron Partnership agreement in place...\".  Is that cutting itclose on the restraint of trade issue?Bob McAuliffe has informed me in a note that if his people (Matson & Cumming)choose the BMC product at testing conclusion, he would support theirdecision.  Smith and Ogg have given \"no go\" indications.  I have receivedthat information from Bruce Smith in a telephone conversation, but Jim Ogg'slack of communication with me is what I have used to draw a similarconclusion for his situation...BMC and EBS both, I believe, are wanting GSS to do the contract work for thisdeal.  It is my understanding, Peter, that the timing of that request mightbe a problem for your guys...Perhaps we should have a quick, informal pow-wowabout this?Thanks,JeffStephen Morse@ENRON COMMUNICATIONSJeff,Attached are all the outstanding deal proposals from BMC.  Lets push for someaddl discounts so we can get each of these guys a \"win\".  I have asked ourBMC contacts to reduce these quotes already due to our partnership but I amsure you know how to handle this best.We need your help Jeff, we cant do it without you.Thanks,STeveSteve MorseEnron Broadband Services713-853-7137-work713-569-7912-cell-----Ann_Munson@bmc.comBernie_Goicoechea@bmc.comHi Steve,It was nice talking to you.  Included here are the Product quotes that wesent to the groups.  The Incontrol has multiple spreadsheets for BruceSmith's projects.  Real Media is for Everett.  The other two are selfexplanatory.The concern that we have is that there is still not a quote for Jim Ogg andtherefore it is not a quantified amount for the deal we're doing together.That is significant because it effects discounts, volume, and certainly themore BMC product that Enron targets the better for this deal.As mentioned in the phone call, I'll send you a soft copy of the Enron Corp(which includes EBS) software license agreement with BMC if I can get it foryou.  Otherwise it will be a hard copy when you come over today.  Itincludes the terms of liability, warranty, etc.I look forward to seeing you today.Best regards,Ann<<Enron RealMedia KM Order 2.xls>>  <<Enron - Doug Cummins team.xls>><<Enron - Randy Matson team.xls>>  <<Enron INCONTROL Product Order Form11-28-00.xls>>Ann M.

Over the past 12 months, East Power mid-marketers have been focused on covering every customer across the eastern interconnect. Our deal flow through June 30, 2001 stands at 201 term transactions vs. 25 at the same time last year. That's an increase of 8 times. This represents outstanding performance.  Many of those transactions have been relatively standard energy block and option structures. The proliferation of EOL   among our customers has had the effect of shrinking standard product margins. Therefore, we need to increase emphasis on customized risk management products in order to optimize value extraction from our customer base.- What is the customers fundamental business(es)- Supply/demand fundamentals- Tariff implications- State regulatory implications- Identify their risks- RTO affiliation- Open access issuesProfiles should be complete by Friday August 10.

  "REFCO Project Update": [
    "jim.goughary@enron.com, l..wilson@enron.com, tim.belden@enron.comGentlemenI wanted to provide you an update on the status of the Refco private label platform deal.  We have had several meetings since I first presented the idea to you all.  Unfortunately, Refco's headquarters was in One World Financial Center which was severely damaged by debris from the World Trade Center collapse.  They suffered no human losses from the disaster, but their offices are off limits and all their computers and paper files are inaccessible for the time being.  They are up and running out of a Jersey City location with some back up capability.To briefly summarize the discussion so far, ENW would build a Refco branded platform similar to EOL that would be accessed by Refco's customers.  Enron would provide transactable prices to the site with wider spreads and potentially smaller minimum volumes.  Refco customers would transact on the site with Refco as their counterparty and Refco would sleeve the transactions to Enron allowing us to consolidate our credit risk to a singular credit, Refco.   The products contemplated include various Nymex look-a-like products and other liquid swaps in oil, natural gas, and electricity.  Revenue would come to Enron in the form of license fees for the platform, transaction fees, and origination from the additional volume create by the wider margin products.  Revenue would come to Refco in the form of transaction fees.  Refco has a similar arrangement in place for FX with Dresner bank and have announced a similar platform for bonds and securities with Cantor Fitzgerald/E-speed.Refco currently has some 175,000 collateralized customer accounts ranging from Institutional Investors & locals down to individuals.  We have put these into 2 buckets which have different profiles.  Phase 1 would include the Top 2000 accounts which are largely substantial institutional investors, locals, and high net worth individuals.  If this proves successful, phase 2 would be rolled out with products designed to attract activity from the smaller investors.  The idea would be to automate the products as much as is practical.Mark Tayor in Legal has already spoken with their counsel and is comfortable that they have reviewed all the legal angles thoroughly.  Refco advises that if the have accounts back up by collateral guaranteed by them, they become Eligible Contract Participants (ECPs) able to execute derivatives.  So, they believe that the majority of the 175,000 accounts they have could be ECPs for the purposes of this deal.  Credit is reviewing the Refco financials and we plan to discuss this thoroughly during their visit.Please do not hesitate to contact me at x36413 if you have any questions or comments and I will be getting in touch with you early next week to get your feedback.RegardsJohn Cummings"

  "RIBFEST -5- (Nov. 3rd)": [
    "The World Wide RibFest \"celebration of the Rib\" is coming up.  This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time).  I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne.For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).  A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a \"peoples choice\" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.  So, appetizers, sides, desserts and food & drink for the kids are also served.  The competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place.  The appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in BellaireMike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing \"personal reasons\"Date & TimeWhere4807 Elm Street in BellaireDirections (from John Mee himself)From downtown, take 59s to 610s. The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit. Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April. Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building. Right before that building is Elm Street. Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street.

  "RM Simulation Storyline Scripts - Ready for Legal Review": [
    "MichelleHere are my very minor comments. However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME's today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature).SheriWhen you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a \"Dateline\" type theme for one, and a \"60 Minute\" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme. In the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers (i.e. title change to manager)?Cheers KirkKirk McDanielMichelleThanks for your support of the BRM project. Here are the remaining scripts. Tim and I will review them too and forward our comments to you. Any feedback on the first two scripts? Again, Thanks!!CheersKirkKirk -I have combined all of the storyline scripts (Intro and Scenarios 1-7) foryou to send to Legal for their review. Your comments were incorporated inthe scripts for scenarios 1 and 2.  We decided to refer to the company asboth Energy Incorporated and Energy Inc. rather than using E.I. so thatthere is no confusion with Enron International. We will not have a coachexit for scenario 5 until EOD tomorrow after the Ed meeting.  In referenceto your concern over \"locking in a price\" as collusion, those werePhillip's words but we hope Legal will decide if we need to change them.Please let me know if you have any questions.Sheri A.

Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced SchedulesMost of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.ICAP RequirementMost of the panelists (except Peter Cramton -- University of MD) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.Standardized MarketsMost of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.Mandatory MarketsOther than Ed Cazalet (APX), the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.ICAPMost of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?  Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.Please call me with questions or comments.Sarah"

  "Refco Update": [
    "Our initial proposal will be for them to keep all their commission and incremental float, and for Enron to keep our spread.  We have talked about it quite a bit and I expect that they will ask for more than this, but we would hesitate giving them the ability to widen our spreads as this could work against the venture if they got too greedy.  Do you have a preference to work into the negotiation?JC-----Original Message-----Are we proposing to pay refco for order flow, like a tick per trade, or are we going to give them our prices and then they widen them to add their juice?-----Original Message-----GentlemenWe met last week with their management and CTO. We have determined the hardware and software requirements for the deal.  We are in the process of drawing up a term sheet and proposing a financial structure.  We have set a meeting for Nov 12 in NYC to get into the details of financial terms and structure.Volumes for Institutional will be 1 contract moving towards 0.5 contract and 0.2 contract possibly to match Nymex mini concept, Volumes for retail will be 0.5 contracts moving to 0.2 contract to match Nymex mini conceptData feed with price and volumes sent from EnronOnline to Refco system customized and powered by EnronOnline softwareInitially target scope is designed for a capacity of 5000 customers, 500 simultaneousRefco will take credit risk for their customers and post daily collateral with EnronRefco will pay Enron a one-time license fee for a 3 year contract with an additional annual maintenance & support feeEnron will keep all additional margin generated by the transactions and Refco will keep the commissions generated and float from additional margin held.Obviously, the above parameters are the preliminary thoughts and subject to change and negotiation.  We are just beginning to model the potential revenue and cost streams and there will likely be some adjustments that will come out of this exercise.  There are also a number of alternative technology scenarios to pursue if we have more or less money to work with.Please feel free to call me x36413 if you have any questions or comments.RegardsJohn Cummings"

    "suresh.raghavan@enron.comsuresh.raghavan@enron.comThanks for the the flexibility,  I believe this will be of great help.  MyCo# is 0985 and RC # is 105081Wack/HOU/EES@EES, Ross Mesquita/NA/Enron@ENRON, SureshRaghavan/Corp/Enron@EnronRegarding the lotting strategy, we do intend to be very flexible. Our generalrecommendation is that the number of lots should be around 10 but if thereare situations where it makes sense to have more than 10 lots, we would nothave a problem with it.From a pricing perspective, as long as bids*lots is less than 150, we wouldtreat it in a similar way.Hope that works for you. Look forward to your confirmation (and the RC#)HarryMesquita/NA/Enron@ENRONHarry-Before we go ahead with this, let's revise the first bullet to reflect a morerealistic variation of how our soliciations might play out over the first andsecond quarter of  2001.As I see it (refer to the attachment for more information), we might conduct,at best, five sealed-bids over the next three months. However, for each ofthe bids there may be more than 10 lots in each bid. Looking at the attachedNotice of Solicitation as an example, we have 7 separate blocks for suppliersto bid having up-to 3 bid scenarios for each block for a total of 21 lots forthis phase. The way I see it, future soliciations will follow a similarmodel.Having said this, an alternative to the current language would be to have 5-6sealed bid opportunities with a 20-25 lot limit for each bid. Does this workfor you or does this complicate the process for your group?Please advise....Sam5-6785Harrell/HOU/EES@EES, Ross Mesquita/NA/Enron@ENRONJohnWe very much enjoyed meeting with you yesterday and discussing opportunitiesfor EES and DealBench to work together.  As we discussed, this email willserve as the framework for our pilot arrangement.  As soon as we receive anemail confirmation from you, your team will be able to add deals to theDealBench platform.3-month access as a standard user (15 sealed-bid deals with up to 10 lots foreach deal) .  Months utilitzed do not need to be consecutive, but if a dealis up on DealBench in any day during a calendar month, that month will beinlcuded as part of the three month period.EES will pay DealBench a fee of $22,500, with $7,500 due immediately, $7,500due February 28th, and $7,500 due March 31st.  We would like to debit your RCdirectly to avoid billing overheads.EES will solely control and be responsible for all business transactions thatit conducts on the DealBench platform.  As such, DealBench assumes noliability for any EES business transactions conducted on DealBench.We believe you will realize significant value from DealBench and look forwardto working with you.  As you know, I am going to be happy when we do a LiveAuction for you and save you some significant money.  Please confirm, withyour RC number that you are IN with this arrangement. We also would want toexplore further the larger opportunity - I will try to allocate some-one towork on that one with you next week.Regards,Harry Arora"

    "PM ---------------------------\"'jarnold@enron.com'\" <jarnold@enron.com><rwolkwitz@POWERMERCHANTS.COM>, \"Kelly, Joseph\" <jkelly@POWERMERCHANTS.COM>By Fiona O'BrienLONDON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - The head of the largest yet Internetexchange for energy products said it will combine traditional anonymitywith transparency to give traders a better overview of market activity.The InterContinentalExchange (ICE), an Atlanta-based ventureinitiated by seven major oil companies and banks is due to launch August24 for trade in precious metals swaps, with energy products trade to golive soon afterwards.While market transparency will increase as dealers used toover-the-counter (OTC) telephone-based market trade on a screen, usersof the ICE will remain nameless up until the point of trade, JeffreySprecher, ICE's chief executive officer told Reuters in an interview.\"As soon as you hit the deal, the system reveals bothcounterparties,\" he said. \"The real strength is that you (still) get theability to manage your own counterparties.\"You can list all of the people you want to do business with and putin the credit terms under which you will do business.\"This information will then be processed by what Sprecher called a\"giant matrix\" within the system.\"(At the moment) people in the over-the-counter market aren't surethey have ever seen the entire market,\" he said.\"(On the ICE), deals you can do will appear in white and deals youcan't do will be in grey, but you can see the entire market.\"Giving players a fuller complement of figures than they are currentlyaware of in a telephone-dominated market should increase markettransparency, as they can keep abreast of the activities of dealers whofall outside their own trading criteria, Sprecher said.The exchange is expected to function in real time around the clockand will be accessible via the public internet or a private networkconnection.Initial liquidity will be provided by founder members BP Amoco<BPA.L>, Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, Morgan StanleyDean Witter <MWD.N>, Royal Dutch/Shell <RD.AS><SHEL.L>, Societe Generale<SOGN.PA> and TotalfinaElf <TOTF.PA>.Shell runs the industry's largest international oil trading operationand Goldman Sachs' J.Aron commodities arm last year was dominantinternationally in unregulated OTC oil derivatives.Late in July the original cast was joined by six gas and powercompanies, American Electric Power <AEP.N,> Utilicorp's Aaquila Energy<UCU.N,> Duke Energy <DUK.N,> El Paso Energy <EPG.N>, Reliant Energy<REI.N> and Southern Company Energy Marketing <SO.N>.Sprecher said continued liquidity would be ensured by the fact thatthe founding members will pay fees even if they do not trade and willface additional penalties if they fail to live up to their commitment totrade a minimum volume.TRADERS STILL TO DO OWN CLEARINGAs well as increasing awareness of market moves, Sprecher believestrading over the Internet could boost trading profits.\"The economics (of the system) will be driven by the fact that apaperless back office can really save a lot of money,\" he said.However such savings on trading the ICE appear some way off giventhat dealers will initially have to continue using their own clearingsystems, as they do in current OTC systems.Under the ICE, once a deal has been struck both counterparties willreceive an electronic deal ticket which will then go through thoseplayers' own risk management systems.But the exchange is eager to look at ways of introducing its ownclearing system.\"No one really knows how at the moment,\" Sprecher said. \"There mightbe some hybrid between traditional exchange clearing and what now existspeer to peer.\"In terms of participation costs, no membership fees will be incurredexcept those associated with trading. Membership is open to anycommercial market participant.Each product will have its own published commission schedule, whichSprecher assessed at \"slightly below the best prices someone would payin the voice broker business\".

I will bring some hardcopy to hit the high points this afternoon.Dave-----Original Message-----Savita,Attached is the latest Robotrader spreadsheet.As you may recall, we tried several different approaches to minimizing the cost of the market running up and then down again.The solution which gave the best solution was also the simplest one.- Basically an advanced Offset to Last Trade- Definitions- General Principles and Mechanics- As each Sell (Buy) occurs, the Momentum decreases (increases).- The Adjusted Momentum is the same as the Momentum, unless the Position Sensitivity is exceeded.- If the Position Sensitivity is exceeded, then the Adjusted Momentum is boosted by the V-Factor Adjustment- The Offset is calculated by looking up the Offset value on a table for the specified Adjusted Momentum- The Spread is calculated by looking up the value to boost (decrease) the Spread on a table for the Specified Intensity- As the Intensity value drops, the Spread widens. As it increases, the Spread decreases.- In a running market, the offset will increase quickly. If it establishes a new level, the Offset will slowly decrease- If the market runs up and whipsaws back, the offset will stay large- If a market range trades, the offset will trend to zero.- If there are a large number of transaction in succession, the spread will widen- If there are a small number of transactions in succession, the spread will tighten.Dave"

Officials from the New York City Mayor's Office for Economic Development as well as NYBOT and Standard & Poor's presided over the launch.Standard & Poor's, a leading provider of global financial information and investment analysis, and the New York Board of Trade, a global marketplace for alternative investment products, developed the SPCI to bring greater definition to traded commodities as an investable asset class. The SPCI was introduced at a ceremony at NYBOT on August 9, 2001. The SPCI futures and options allow managers and investors to add real diversification to their portfolios through a single, transparent access point to the investment opportunities found in commodity futures markets.\"The launch of this new product so soon after the events of September 11, and on a trading floor so imaginatively developed before the event, allowing NYBOT to start trading so soon after the loss of its facility in lower Manhattan, is a testament to the strength and the resilience of New Yorkers,\" said Michael G. Carey, President, New York City Economic Development Corporation. \"Let no one doubt that New York is and continues to be the financial and trading capital of the world.\"\"To contribute successfully to long-term portfolio goals, an alternative asset should have certain key characteristics, namely a proper benchmark, transparency, liquidity, simplicity, cost efficiency and flexible trading capabilities,\" said NYBOT President and CEO Mark D. Fichtel. \"SPCI futures and options are among the few investment instruments that meet all the criteria for a real alternative asset. We believe that these new contracts will prove particularly valuable to investors and managers who need alternative investment strategies in these difficult economic times.\"\"SPCI futures and options give investors a direct means to obtain exposure to a diversified commodity basket,\" said Robert Shakotko, Standard & Poor's Managing Director of Index Services. \"Investors around the world recognize the S&P reputation for equity indices and index products. We now bring these same business strengths to commodities.\"The SPCI tracks 17 commodities in six sectors including grains, meat and livestock, metals, softs (coffee, sugar, cocoa), fibers, and energy. The index utilizes real-time prices of the relevant futures contracts traded on the commodities futures markets in New York and Chicago. Key features of the SPCI include its geometric calculation methodology and a weighting adjustment that eliminates double counting of upstream and downstream commodities.The new SPCI futures and options contracts will support and enhance other index-linked investment products. They offer an easy and efficient way to manage commodity index funds, commodity-linked insurance products, or commodity exposure in multi-asset products. As with its equity indices, Standard & Poor's has initiated a licensing program for the SPCI directed at financial institutions that might use the new commodity index as part of an innovative investment product."

  "SEC Information/Earnings Restatement": [
    "Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties;-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.Restatement of Earnings-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments."

    "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 11/17/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>Enclosed is the cost breakdown for the appraiser.  Note that theconstruction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than ourstandard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratioof 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costsare high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we haveactual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psfwithout overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairlysure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3bedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detachedgarages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.- winmail.dat"

    "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 02/21/2001Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>There have been some updates to the cost.  The principal change is in theaddition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate willcosts at least $84,000 additional.  Also, the trim material and labor costshave been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more thansufficient, but there will be additional updates.The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&Ntotal of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit andoffice is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in asa rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanentmortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for theconstruction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when thisloan is obtained.Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, theconstruction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.George W.

I understand you will beobtaining the SMEs who will be providing us with expert stories.  Thank youmix of structurers, originators and tradersI've included below a slightly revised version of the process that we willfollow for working with the SMEs to develop and film the stories.  The maindifference is that we need to get the list of SMEs by 11/28, instead of11/30.  By 11/30, we need to have contacted the SMEs and set up time withthem for the following week. I think that to contact 10 SMEs will take atleast 2 days, especially since one of the days is a Friday.(11/26-11/28)--Obtain contact information for expert story SMEs(11/28-11/30)--Contact SMEs to give them background regardingthe simulation, describe their role in the simulation, set up a time todiscuss ideas, and set up a time for video shoot.(12/3-12/6)--Meet with SMEs to discuss the categories of content weneed and where they can provide stories.--Send follow-up e-mail asking SMEs to review thestories (questions and answers) that we will ask them during the videoshoot.--Make changes to stories, if necessary.--Send final stories and video shoot logistics toSMEs(12/10-12/12)--Video shootPlease let me know if you have any questions.Thanks,AnnThis message is for the designated recipient only and may containprivileged, proprietary, or otherwise private information.

    "sureGriffith/Corp/Enron@Enron, Dutch Quigley/HOU/ECT@ECTJohn,Thank you for your flexibility regarding the asian option we purchased fromyou (average Feb-Aug GD HH settle).  Unfortunately, our customer would liketo settle on 7 days, using the preceding day for any day for which Gas Dailyis not published (i.e., Friday prices would be used for Saturday and Sunday)- so I know it's not your preference, but I need to take advantage of youroffer.Regards,Garyx31511John ArnoldI can do it either way but would much rather just make it the simple averageof prices, 5 per week.John(s),How will the Asian options we purchased from the gas desk settle with respectto weekends... will the average of every day's gas daily settle mean theaverage of only the days on which Gas Daily is published?  or will it triplecount each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with asimilar calculation on weekends).  I assume it is the former, not thelatter.  Is this correct?  Are you indifferent if we want to switch to thelatter?  Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn'tmatter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above theaverage as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so letme know.Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need thesettlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need toargue for one or the other.Regards,Garyx31511"

In preparation for that meeting we would like togain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What aretypical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your maincontacts at SW Gas?We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving ourcontrol of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probablyhave to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with thecommissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from theircommissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....)should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of monthindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  Thatrisk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation oftheir PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatlyappreciated.Thanks,Laird"

First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement fromKeith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals inthe transaction.2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC)willbe in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within theacceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-formaperformance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my creditofficer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officersigning off on the deal.3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developersdeferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget asdeferred profit has been acceptable.Thanks,Andrew OzunaReal Estate Loan Officer210-271-8386##"

    "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/08/2001---------------------- Forwarded by Andrew M Ozuna/TX/BANCONE on 03/07/2001Andrew M OzunaGeorge,Thank you for the opportunity to review your financing request for theSagewoodPhase II project.  Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding theproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are anumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forwardon the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on aBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjustedpro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we areacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about500+units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos,this,we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a seriouseffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requestedloan amount to $8,868,000.Pro-Forma                           Bank's AdjustmentUnit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $4753 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $4172.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unitturn over.3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can supportdebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25xdebtcoverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provideLand -                   $1,121,670Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000Cash Equity              $1,419,268Total                    $2,955,9387.

    "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/08/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><invest@bga.com>I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lotduplex project, was selling his units in the $180's,  He does have a muchlower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are dueto a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one ofthe duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sqfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought hissales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sellfor $203,108.What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) therent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your ownevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if wewere able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroomunits along with the 3-bedroom plan.Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.Sincerely,George W.

  "San Juan Index": [
    "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/28/2000Liane,As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt tomanipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a singlebuyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid abovemarket prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades,offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices werebypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the indexcalculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associatedfinancial swaps for San Juan.We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed fromSeptember 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades fromEnron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokeragefirms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for atrade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gasdaily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greaterthan the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September andOctober gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices thatare dramatically different.I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, thetrades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able todetermine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades areoutliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid inestablishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from thecalculation of index.It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which toconduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact meanytime I can assist you towards this goal.Sincerely,Phillip Allen"

Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the...6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week. Then, early in the...11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.Sat \t11/17\t47 BcfdSun\t11/18\t52 BcfdMon\t11/19\t55 BcfdTue\t11/20\t67 BcfdWed\t11/21\t69 BcfdThu\t11/22\t65 BcfdFri\t11/23\t65 BcfdSat\t11/24\t63 BcfdSun\t11/25\t63 BcfdMon\t11/26\t65 BcfdTue\t11/27\t65 BcfdTill tomorrow,The Weather Team"

    "Hey John!How are you??  I've been following the Enron story closely, which means I'vethought of you a lot recently.  I hope things are going well, despite theuncertainty.I ran into someone from our Enron days today, which made me think of a funnystory.  Do you remember when John Mee tried to eat 8 Big Macs and hurledinstead?  John was talking to my boss, Chuck Clough, today, who he's knownsince childhood and is a mentor of sorts.  When he got off the phone, Chucktold me who he was talking to and the name John Mee struck me as familiar.I asked Chuck if he was a big kid who'd gone to Harvard and he said yes.  SoI tell him the Big Mac story and Chuck picks up the phone and calls John toask him if that was him because if so, I knew him.  Poor thing says \"yeah,that was me, but not one of my finer moments...\"  I could tell he wasembarrassed.  I guess there are some things in life you just never livedown.I also ran into some friends of yours in Bermuda last month.  We shared acab to the airport and realized we had all been at Enron, though not at thesame time.  I mentioned that I really loved the company, especially howyoung it was and that I had a friend who joined right out of undergrad andis now doing really well.  They immediately said \"John Arnold!\"  Shocked thehell out of me, honestly.  They were very funny in saying that I had made a\"bad trade\" by marrying my husband instead of you.  I told them I would keepthat in mind....  ;-}  I would tell you their names, but I can't rememberoff the top of my head.  They both work for a weather trading firm in theNortheast now, with Lynda Clemmons.Well, gotta run to the gym - been putting it off as long as I could today.I really do hope you're doing well.  Please drop me a line when you aren'ttrading up a storm...Warm regards,Heather_______________________________Heather Lockhart Robertson, DirectorClough Capital Partners, LP260 Franklin Street, 19th FloorBoston, MA  02110"

We are all holding significant gas positions in California and are greatly affected by any gas or power developments withing the state.With regard to Socal's comments, do you have any additional information?  This is quite a 180 from the presentations that Socal has been giving to the CPUC and at other forums.  Until now they have been consistently stating that they will have plenty of gas.Phillip-----Original Message-----[Mark Hall]-----Original Message-----Just heard this on an IEP call and wanted to pass it along.SoCal gas has announced that it may have to curtail gas to power plants this summer.  SoCal Gas says it has to put gas in storage for winter and may not be able to do that and serve the power plants. Apparently, SoCal is shipping gas to Mexico at the same time. That will not look good to CA politicians.Sue MaraEnron Corp."

No hand-outs were provided.Calculation of Receipt Point CapacityTopock  540 mmcf/dEhrenberg 1250 mmcf/dNeedles 800 mmcf/dWheeler 800 mmcf/dNew Receipt PointsKramer Junction 200 mmcf/dHector Rd 50 mmcf/dBoth will be available around Feb 1Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows CalculationCurrently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.New Calculation, Changes and DisplayBased on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.OFO DeclarationName changes from overnominationCan declare before any CycleProvide 2 hour noticePost on Gas SelectShow OFO Calculation on Gas SelectWindowsReason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into systemCalculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO'sNow customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.Scheduling Changes-Nov 1Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycleCopy confirmed nomsAll noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.2 Hour NoticeSocal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFONominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.Use Elapsed Pro-Rata RulesExpected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cutCycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cutCylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cutWindows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled VolumesCycle 1                                    Cycle 2Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1Cycle 3\t\t\t\tevening cyle 2 on 10/4Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.Winter Balancing RulesEffective Nov 1-March 31No changes.All customers must comply.Minimum delivery requirements50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)70% of daily usage depending on storage level70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min90% of daily usage depending on storage level90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)"

One for the gasgenerators is still quite a ways off.The non gas fired QFs will be getting a fixed price for 5 years and revertingback to their contracts thereafter.  They also will give backI would expect that the gas deal using an implied gas price times a heat ratewould be very very difficult to close.  Don't expect hedgers to come any timesoon.I will keep you abreast of developments.C---------------------- Forwarded by Chris H Foster/HOU/ECT on 01/26/2001Susan J Mara@ENRONPhillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, JeffDasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Michael Etringer/HOU/ECT@ECT, James DSteffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@Enron, PaulKaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Chris H Foster/HOU/ECT@ECTRE;  Non-Gas-fired QFs -- The last e-mail I sent includes the latest versionof the IEP proposal.  Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentiallycomplete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed withthe IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would \"retain\" $106 million (ofwhat, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs whoswitched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for theQF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December(and maybe earlier).PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take theForce Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to getsome assurances of payment.SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are dueon 2/2/01.For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E'spurchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can beresolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on thisoccurred today.Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much willhappen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .

    "One of the most likely scenarios for a VAR blowout would be a severe coldfront hitting the country in the middle to latter part of the winter.  Insuch a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to howMidwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futureswere $200.  The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong,and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread positioncurrently.  But in the winter that may change.Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is theassymetric risk presented by having a spread position on.  Assuming we enterthe winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of longcash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side.While such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the20%  $ -.0540%     $ -.0220% $ 019% $ .031% $ 1Enron North America Corp.RAC is working on developing some \"canned\" stress tests regarding VaR.

  "Summary of Initial Findings": [
    "Dear Harry and Dave,I wanted to summarize where we are currently at in relation to the Automated Confirms project and to pass on our preliminary findings from our analysis. Bear with me this is a long email.We completed a very high-level analysis of the value we believe would be created for Enron, Enron's trading partners, and a Systems Integrator. We based our model on the architecture you have currently proposed.The value created for Enron Online will be significant based on value associated with increasing the volume of trades on Enron Online and driving additional liquidity into the market. We also included, in the Enron value calculation, revenue for providing the service to trading partners. We believe additional value will also be created by offering other products through this channel but we did not estimate this.By leveraging some in-depth analysis we did based on other markets (not power and gas) the value to Enron's largest trading partners for doing automated confirms is not quite as compelling as it might appear on the surface. Our high-level estimates put the value at around $800 thousand per year on average. This is made up of reduced risk from incorrectly marked deals, more accurate position reporting, and efficiencies in the mid and back office personnel. Based on your current model it would cost a trading company $200-$500 thousand dollars to set up the service plus ongoing transaction fees or subscriptions. This service might not be as easy to sell as we initially thought.Based on your proposed architecture, the system integrator revenue would be $200K - $400K per installation for somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 - 20 major trading partners. Assuming an average of $300K for 15 sites the total services fees would be a total of $4.5 million without including any additional fees from ongoing transactions.You must make this as easy and inexpensive as possible to get organizations connected, possibly viewing this as a loss leader. This is because the largest value is created for Enron through increased transaction throughput not from charging for the service. Alternatively, you might think of adding additional services from day one to increase the value to the trading companies and get them to sign up more rapidly. You may want to consider co-operating with other online / offline services to increase number of automated confirms so that trading companies can take greater advantage of the Enron service.You should take another look at the architecture and give consideration to how you could more easily get companies online, possibly without the need for large integration fees or additional hardware. Once people are online it would be easier to sell a more robust solution that would involve actually putting a server on their premise.You might want to consider some type of market assessment of the trading partners to determine exactly what they would like but more importantly what they would be willing to pay for. This could dramatically alter your go-to-market strategy.As I shared with Dave, at this point without further analysis or a change to the proposed model, we (Ed, Milind, and I) would never be able to get Sapient to agree to  a significant cash investment in the partnership. What we would propose could take the form of \"sweat equity\" on the part of Sapient to train a team on the API's and feet on the street to go and talk to trading companies about the opportunity.We also could offer to do a co-funded (Sapient and Enron) market assessment to take a two to four weeks to flush out the business model and analyze what trading companies would be willing to pay for in the way of additional products and services. We do believe that if you completed the assessment you would be better able to strengthen your go-to-market strategy.Keep in mind that we are sharing these thoughts because we do want to develop a relationship and just as importantly want your team to be successful in this venture even if that means there is not a role for Sapient. Also if someone is telling you something that is contrary to our findings based on their analysis please give me a call because I definitely want to understand if we are fundamentally missing something.I will follow-up with each of you over the next week to see how you are progressing. Please call or email me with any thoughts or reactions.Sincerely,Lee HendersonDirector, Energy Services(713) 402 - 1618"

  "Summer Interns": [
    "Here is my summary of our second round summer interviews.  Top 3 candidatesbelow.1. Craig -  Well rounded, Military background, excellent leadershipexperience (aircraft carrier pilot), did not have a finance background, butperformed very well on Harry's analytical interview.  Very personable,confident and sold himself well.  I think he is very interested in Enron andwould likely accept.2. Victor - He was a strong candidate in my more subjective interview, but Ididn't think he was quite as strong as Ajay.  However he outperformed Ajay inthe analytical interview.  With that feedback from Harry I feel comfortableplacing Victor ahead of Ajay.  Also very interested in Enron.3. Ajay -  Very polished, presented/sold himself very well, Excellentunderstanding of Enron's business (did his homework),  Relative to othersbased on my interview he ranked in the top 2, However did not perform as wellas others in the top 4-5 in the analytical interview.  For this reason I'dpush him back to number three.Aside from these three there were two others that are worth discussing.Casey JonesAndrew RosenbergWe Understand these two may have outstanding offers from firms that they arevery interested in.  I would not consider either of these two ahead of Craig,but might place Casey ahead of Victor.  However I think Casey is least likelyto accept the offer.  My suggestion would be to make offers to Craig &Victor, then consider a 3rd offer to Andrew, recognizing we would likely geta maximum of 2/3.Lee Jackson"

As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.Thank you for your support.Enron Global Technology-----Original Message-----Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where \"name\" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any \"spaces\" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format.

This was expected to be released sometime in January. We think going ahead will act as an indicator that as far as our core businesses are concerned it is business as usual and we are contiuing to develop the platform.Before proceeding however we would like to get your opinion on  whether this is something we should even be considering at this point .

I have asked Zimin Lu(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so theywill be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of thismeeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone iscomfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure thosewho are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I haveheard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity todiscuss them.Please let me know if you are unable to attend."

Since we're ending 2000 and going into a new sales year, Iwant to make sure I'm not holding resource open on any accounts which maynot, or should not be on the list of focus accounts which you and your teamhave requested our involvement with.  I also want to make sure I'm bringingresource to bear on the accounts which you DO want to engage.For example, at one point Siemens was one of them, and with recentdevelopments, may now be off your list...the last communication I receivedwhere they informed me that the primary opportunity looked like it would bewith one of their medical groups based in Chicago.  After severalunsuccessful follow-up attempts, I placed the Siemens account in the dormantcategory.  Yesterday, Jennifer forwarded me information requesting engagementwith your team on CA (Computer Associates) and U.S. Internetworking, andtoday American Express has surfaced.  Consequently, I think it's probably agood idea for me to make sure I'm focused on the right accounts for you.I realize you may be in PRC today and/or tomorrow, so perhaps Friday wouldwork?  If not, I would have Monday the 18th available late afternoon, or anytime on December 27th, 28th, or 29th.  When would be good for you?  Pleaselet me know!Thank you,Jeff"

    "Carlos,Can you help me with several 1031 exchange questions?  I spoke to your office and they thought it best that I address my questions to you directly.Here is my situation.  I purchased a 32 acre tract in Leander about 8 months ago.  I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th.Purchase price\t\t1,200,000Fees&Devel costs\t  500,000Profit\t\t\t 400,000The cash generated at the sale will be close to $1 million after repayment of a loan.I am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange.I am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify.First, there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner, Ltd for $1.15 million six months ago.  I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project.  We could not come to terms for the development, so the partnership was conveyed to me.  The loan still exist.  I am an 80% limited partner.  Another investor is the other limited partner.  We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner.  We intend to develop the property. Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange?Second,  I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $400,000.  I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing.  I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually, but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP.If neither of these deals qualify, I would still like to find another piece of property.  My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name.  Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different entity?Thank you in advance for your help.Phillip Allen8855 Merlin CtHouston, TX 77055pallen70@hotmail.comwk 713-853-7041hm 713-463-8626"

    "Dear U.S. Soccer Family,As another year comes to a close, we wanted to thank each and every one of you for your support. The last 12 months have been extremely successful for both our senior National Teams and our Youth National Teams and 2002 promises to be exciting on all fronts.The U.S. Men's National Team qualified for our fourth straight World Cup, setting the stage for an exciting 2002 tournament, while the U.S. Women took their first steps toward the 2003 Women's World Cup by building on the successful launch of the WUSA this past summer. In the year ahead, our men will be focused on the Korea/Japan World Cup, where we will square off against Portugal, South Korea and Poland in June. We are confident that with your support and the right preparation, we will have a successful tournament. For the U.S. Women, our goals are no less tangible, with preparation for the 2003 Women's World Cup qualifying becoming the focus of our activities.For our youth national teams, we saw our U-17 and U-20 Men's teams qualify for FIFA's bi-annual World Youth Championships in those age brackets. In 2002, our Under-19 Women's National Team will have the opportunity to compete in the first ever FIFA Women's World Youth Championship, with qualifying scheduled for May in Trinidad & Tobago and the actual tournament set for Canada in August. This is real progress for the development of the women's game and we expect our team to successfully qualify and then compete for the title of this first-ever event.In all of the world championships, we have the opportunity to measure ourselves against the best teams in the world, and that helps to motivate our athletes. But it is the support we receive from our U.S. Soccer family and fans that inspires our players. Again, thank you for your support throughout the year and into the future. We look forward to a successful 2002.Sincerely,Bruce Arena                               April HeinrichsHead Coach & Technical Director           Head Coach & Technical DirectorU.S. Men's National Team                  U.S. Women's National Team----------------------------------------------------------------------------"

  "Thank you for dinner last night": [
    "Good question.  The exchange, NYMEX, and I, Enron Online, offer a nearlyidentical product.  The fight is over which execution model is superior.  Iwould argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct.  It'shappened in Europe already.  The largest commodity exchange in Europe, theLIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry.  Within weeks,the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically.  Istill trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individualsand certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct.The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful.It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address.JohnDear Mr. Arnold,It was nice to meet you yesterday at theinformation session.  Thank you for the dinner last night.I had a great time getting to know Enron and its people ina more relaxed setting.During out conversation yesterday, I was confusedabout a point you made. You stated that you spent most ofyour time on the phone with Traders in New York.  Whenyou talk to the traders, do you try to steer them towardsEnron Online, or are you doing trading outside of EnronOnline?  I think the underlying question that I am asking,or is it meant to bypass traders completely.Thanks again for your time and for dinner.

In testing the equipment today, I realized for the first time that our fiber feed involved that big black box that you've undoubtedly noticed.  I was unaware that that would be necessary.  We really view this as temporary because we are planning to move all video activity to the new building before the end of the year.

    "THE FRIDAY BURRITO\"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate.\"=0F\"Are those folks smoking crack?=0F\" he asked in an outrage.  My friend, =Ol=0F'Dave in Houston, has trouble understanding the workings of our powerbusiness here in California.  In fact, so do I.  Yesterday=0F's JointSenate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing toimprove either Dave=0F's or my understanding of the national embarrassmentCalifornia is perpetrating with electricity deregulation.=0F\"The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcingutilities to build power plants and transmission,=0F\" he mused between sipsof Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers.  =0F\"Come to thinkof it, Dave, they did say something about that. Yeah,=0F\" I recalled,=0F\"Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing theISO or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market buildthem.  I can=0F't remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOBChairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into Stateagencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=0F\"I know what you are thinking right now.  The next thing you knowCalifornia will have regulated retail rates.  That recipe should be outof the PUC=0F's oven sometime next week.=0F\"Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to theISO=0F's bid cap.   There is no way you can tell me that a generatorplanned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=0F\" Dave added. =0F\"So you agreewith Herr (Hair) Peace!  You don=0F't believe in markets,=0F\" I retorted. ==0F\"Oh,I believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade,and without any notice or advanced warning, the price in the Midwestmarket went against me,=0F\" Dave recalled.  =0F\"I called everyone who I tra=dedwith, and they had nothing.  I finally called XXXXX, and I asked whatwill it cost for 50 MW?=0F\"=0F\"Why didn=0F't you ask for 300?=0F\" I wondered.  =0F\"I didn=0F't want to=show him myposition.  You get hosed when you show the buyer your position.  Ask for50, first,=0F\" Dave chided.=0F\"What happened?=0F\" =0F\"Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH.  I said I==0F'dtake it, and then said I needed another fifty.  He asked $300.  I tookthat, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=0F\" lamented Dave.  =0F\"He justwanted to see how far he could push me. That=0F's what I mean when I saythe traders are jigging it.=0F\"=0F\"But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function iswhat mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guessat the price.  Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guesswrong.  But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed onto the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost ofa generating plant.=0F\"And there you have it.  Put in a price cap, and the traders have atarget for which to shoot.  I can=0F't prove the following, yet, but I=0F'l=lwager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the averagetrading price climbs even as the so-called =0F\"dysfunctional=0F\" price spik=esare eliminated.  Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economicprinciple is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with theimposition of an additional constraint.I feel better already.  Here is what is on our short agenda this week.>>> Things in the Mailbag>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California@@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report@@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings@@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)>>> Things in the MailbagIt has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch.Here is what my friends have been writing me.FPL Energy=0F's Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me, =0F\"Please Gary=,no more whining about your computer.   How old are you?? Is this theyear you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment.  Do you reallynot know how to spell Morro Bay???  Please let us know what is going onwith your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron???Bay!!!!=0F\"It is good to have friends like Steve.  They make the pain of separationso much easier. And Steve, when you FPL guys get that Entergy mergersorted out, in a dozen years or so, you let us know. I want toparticipate in the name selection for the new entity.  How aboutFentergy PLus?Next, from the PX=0F's Mark Hoppe, who writes, =0F\"As you've heard fromothers, I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this materialeach week. The burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains asprinkle of irony, tragedy (ISO Drama).  Though you are usually neutralregarding the PX, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate.  Ithink we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in theindustry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX tosuccessfully open this market.=0F\"Thanks, Mark.  I just want you to know that my ability to write thisstuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence.  I havelearned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace, that as long as you can talk(write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless ofhow groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience.A few weeks ago, I received from the PX=0F's Jennifer Sherwood a note,which she wants you to know are her opinions, not necessarily the PX=0F's.It=0F's okay, Jennifer.  I paid George,yesterday, the $20 I owed him forthat sham Rose Bowl bet, (remember?, Stanford lost) and your opinionsare cool with us.  =0F\"Just curious - has anyone been comparing highunleaded prices to high CA electricity prices?  What I mean is, we areup in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diegoconsumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflatedunleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last fewmonths?  No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer fromhow much it costs to fill their gas tank.  No mention is made of thosewho can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't affordthe extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon.  The costs are passed along to theconsumer without pause.  Granted there are differences between theunleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-sideresponsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =0F`Ican't drive today because gas is too expensive=0F'vs. =0F`I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=0F'=0F\"Finally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am notthe [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote.  Ugh!  I too noted thatthe \"speak fast\" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace.  My goodness,what a mess we have.  I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spokevolumes.  My sources at FERC tell me, though, that we should keep an eyeout for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored]... for political reasons.  Given no Commission meetings til September,the only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can't doall that much.=0F\">>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California@@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB ReportSeveral of you people commented to me that the ISO=0F's reply to thePUC/EOB report was very good.  I decided to excerpt the best sections ofit for the Burrito.  The full document can be found on the ISO=0F'swebsite.=0F\"... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities ofcertain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading tothe Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact, the events of June 13and June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltageinstability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone-- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specificlocal area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import ofgeneration from outside the area.=0F\"The Report states that the ISO =0F\"never tried=0F\" to call upon consume=rs toreduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact, the ISOhad in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed toreduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, underwhich customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtailenergy use in exchange for a fee=0F\"The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by=0F`purchasers=0F' of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $=1.2billion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with themistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid bythe UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However, in determining thetotal cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forwardcontracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energymarkets. These contracts, which are designed to =0F\"lock-in=0F\" a specificprice in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, arespecifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, andare standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe thatsome of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of therecent price spikes.=0F\"In a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =0F\"might well==0F\"have saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place inMay and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases wouldhave been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times ofpeak demand, when all of the state=0F's generation has been exhausted, theISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In orderto secure the necessary power, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateralbasis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=0F's controlarea.=0F\"The Report asserts that California power markets =0F\"are not nowcompetitive=0F\" and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is thenormal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committeehas noted that =0F\"market power in the California energy market appears toariseprimarily during periods of peak demand,=0F\" and warned that demand growthwould increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000.=0F\"The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interestedboard and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not thecase. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act andto the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, thatwholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the publicinterest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed andapproved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually everyaspect of the ISO=0F's business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC.The FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by thestate agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participantsin the FERC proceedings.=0F\"The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affectedby restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have madeCalifornia more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion isunfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring statescoupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in bothgeneration and transmission have caused this vulnerability.Restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold.Only by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval andsiting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements willthis significant shortage be addressed.=0F\">>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California@@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate HearingsIf you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve Californialegislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongsof electric restructuring.  Also imagine, as if you are in the TwilightZone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in theirfacts.  Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=0F's Joint Senate/Assemblyhearing was like.It started over two hours late.  The Senate was busy congratulating oneof their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted toheap on the glory.  That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner BillKeese.  Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it,and he does, it is always the same story.  It is the heat storm story.One can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is asingle-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry landwith her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy.  They aresearching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the graceof God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberalreturns on investment.Being the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm)of the day.  The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable.  Last week, SanDiegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and didnot receive one penny of compensation (I=0F'm not making that up ... Hesaid it).  He is sick of hearing about demand management as being asolution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about donelistening.  People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden pricehikes.  Yikes!Keese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, butin neighboring Arizona, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!!  Mr. Keesecorrectly pointed out that electric power is not solely a Californiaproblem, it is a regional problem.  One member of the Committee askedwhat the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting andconstruction process?Keese referred to Governor Gray Davis=0F' Executive Order issued last weekto which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a6 month permitting time line.  The six months are enough if theapplicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, andair offsets.  Hmmmmmm.  That alone might take six months before you getto the CEC.The next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch.  I went toohard on her last week, calling her Let=0F's Do Lynch.  That was a 0.8 TPC.Sorry.  I promise to be nicer starting now.  The Energy Fuhrerinstructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert thepass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunctionof the market is cured.  Put it in an escrow account.  Ms Lynch promisedto review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enactSDG&E rate caps (told you).The star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith.Mr. Smith comes to Sacramento.  Isn=0F't that a switch?  Mr. Smith came inplace of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord.  Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese whatthese 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way.The 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare thewholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to giveback the money they over collected.  When can we do that?  Mr. Smithanswered as only a FERC attorney can answer.  There is a process.  Ittakes time.  You must have evidence.  FERC uses a three-part criteriafor assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.  It=0F'sbased on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of highprices.  You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best youcould hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand fromthe US Court of Appeals.Slowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12.  They werestumped.  Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed, couldn=0F't you, Mr. Smith of FERC,today use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, thatgenerators who had market based rates have exercised market power, andretro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region?Like a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiarstrains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner.  Back andthe past I hated the process at FERC.  Today, I have a renewed respectfor what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of amob.For the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could beundertaken by the PUC.>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California@@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale MarketWell, the official title is, =0F\"Order Instituting Investigation into theFunctioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact onRetail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas &Electric Company=0F\".  I like my title better.This Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of theCommission, on August 3.  It calls for an investigation of the wholesalemarkets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference inSan Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center.=0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a=ndsmall commercial customers?

  "The Stage": [
    "Jeff,I don't understand what you want me to do with this letter.  Regarding the utilities,  you and I know that I have had the right to shut off the utilities to a property I don't own for sometime now.  I did not do that because I wanted to stay on good terms with the Kuo's while negotiating the release.  I had the utilities taken out of my name yesterday.  The city of seguin informs me that the meters were read yesterday and the final bill will be mailed to me next week.  Then I can compute the amount that the Kuo's owe me for utilities and send them a check for the rock repairs.  Please let Pauline know that she needs to go down to the city and take care of the deposit by Friday or the power may be disconnected.  The utilities are already in her name.In my mind the utilities were never a bargaining chip.  Rather, you and I are paying the $11,000 in exchange for the release.  Regarding the transfer of ownership into a limited partnership, I will most likely be agreeable to this but I want to review all the loan documents with Jacques and ensure that there is still a personal guarantee on the two notes.  I expect to have that done by Friday.I will call you when I am comfortable consenting to the limited partnership.Phillip-----Original Message-----I spoke with Pauline and she says she is ready to transfer the utilities.However, she wants to get your signed permission to transfer their ownershipinterests to the J&P Kuo, Ltd. for purposes of paying back the two notes.(per her attorneys advice).  She is ready to sign the settlement, but shehas not been able to talk to her lawyer who is tied up in court.I have attached a Word file with the a letter to them which authorizes thetransfer.  If it is acceptable please sign and fax to her directly at830-372-5400.

In thepast, I have not made a habit of participating in PaineWebber syndicateofferings because, frankly, investment banking was not our strong suit.Now, with the UBS merger, our deal flow is starting to look much better (seepress release below).  5.79% isn't a mind-blowing number, but it isimpressive in light of market conditions and the fact that \"UBS Warburg wasthe only bank to have a positive return among the 17 banks listed includingMerrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Salomon Smith Barney.\"As the market rebounds, I think you may benefit from participation in IPOsand other syndicate deals.

  "The fall in French job creation stabilises": [
    "The fall in French job creation stabilisesNon farm payrolls (Q3)Non farm payrolls are clearly a good surprise as we expected the growthrate to continue to plummet. However, the fall in labour productivity andthe results from surveys lead us to believe that employment growth willcontinue to slow. This underpins our pessimistic scenario for Franc in thecoming months.* Non farm payrolls are better than expected. But, after a 1.0% qoq growthrecorded in Q4 last year, 0.8% in Q1 and 0.3% in Q2 and Q3 job creation ismuch less dynamic.* The number also show that the sharp increase in unemployment was partlydue to an unusually high dynamism of the labour force on the wake of thesuppression of the military service.* During the first two quarters of the year, job creation was faster thanGDP resulting in a fall in labour productivity. With growth expected at0.3% in Q3, non farm payrolls suggest that France could register a third(marginal) fall in labour productivity. This calls for a correction. Jobcreation growth could fall quicker in the coming quarters.* Job growth was essentially driven by the service sector. Since 1995, morethan 95% of the new jobs were created in that sector. The deceleration alsocomes from this sector. After a growth pick at 1.2%qoq in 00Q4, growth wasonly 0.5 % in Q3 this year. This is hardly a surprise given, for instance,the sharp decline in temp agency work.St?phane D?oEconomic ResearchUBS WarburgStephane.deo@ubsw.com"

TheWSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS,which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposesthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, butthere can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\"generation.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn't schedule theirgeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then youwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern californiamunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is,if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simplyschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having saidall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives onthe generation side.On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  Whilethey don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number isbetter than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on theload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this withothers up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gasdemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity,especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small theUEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginalconsumer then it is obviously a different story.Let's talk."

  "Transport p&l": [
    "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 05/30/2000Phillip--I've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strangeto me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not bean issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this isO.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me toget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know andI'll take care of it..On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygatecurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of$235,019.(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change youroverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affectssomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)GDP-Kingsgate.Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see fivedifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be forwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as aQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means isthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transportlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have asystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seemsthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times,the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's thedetail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where itappears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may bean operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollarimpact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just incase there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show thevolumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.Deal #  251327                  159540                   265229106300   201756P&L  $29,503                ($15,960)                ($3,199)($2,769)   ($273)Gr RvrBasin/0852   Ques/Clay Basin    Ques/Clay Basin1        329       8,7382     1,5003         2,974    11,3624         6,741    12,349       1,4395       19,052          3,1839            33313  30,863       2,68014  30,45115  35,22616         6,979              23517  17,46418    9,29420  10,796          77121  17,93022  10,66723       14,415          9,07625  23,934       8,69526     3,28427         1,97628     1,75129     1,59130  20,242"

    "(\"Tri-State\")Maria Garza and I checked.  We only see the two trades (TAGG numbers) you reference, none other.  It is our opinion that these trades represent all of the financial GAS positions.  Note that these two trades ended w/ the Feb02 settlement period.I cannot speak to power or any other commodity.  However, I can provide that Credit Agg didn't show any position exposure for Tri State, which we think is consistent considering there is no existing forward [gas] market price exposure to Tri State.In summary, my opinion is that there are no other positions.  However, only Beth Apollo's group can provide a conclusive answer.  Hope this helps.-----Original Message-----Just a reminder that ENA received a letter from Tri-State last month and you are going to verify that Deal Nos.

    "Good to hear.  There continue to be a proliferation of new systems comingonline in the US; two more start in the next two months.  We are pretty closeto finalizing a plan to open our system to everyone in terms of acceptinglimit orders and posting best bid/offer regardless of whose it is.  In thisframework, Enron would sleeve credit for free should two third parties bematched on our system.  However, we would hold the book, getting to see whateveryone was doing at all times.  The idea is that if we can move theindustry's order flow from 30-40% EOL to 60% EOL, we get a huge informationadvantage in addition to a couple trading advantages, namely we have firstpriority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by acounterparty before us and second, we posess a proprietary stack manager thatwill allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than ourcompetitors.  Still working on technical issues.  The decision to open EOLmarkets would be done on a product by product basis.  Give me a call if youwant to discuss.Andrew FairleyJohnRedmond & I have now had a few weeks to implement some of your advice withregard to EOL for UK gas.We have managed to double our average daily volumes, and are capturing aconsiderably greater share of the market. (We estimate 50% now).Spectron are getting about 20-30% of the number of trades we do. There arestill some counterparties who insist on paying through our numbers and payingbrokerage so they do not show us what we are doing!  As far as we areconcerned we only use SpectronLive on UK gas when we are  executing thestrategy you mentioned below.Once again, thanks for your helpAll the best,AndyJohn ArnoldEnjoyed meeting with you.One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume toEOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viableelectronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these ifpossible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greaterthan our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination tobuy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and movemy market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get thetrade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad tradeto him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the othersystems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers onthe other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader onSpectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, ormetals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the othertraders.JohnAndrew FairleyNeal/HOU/ECT@ECT, Thomas A Martin/HOU/ECT@ECT, Barry Tycholiz/NA/Enron@ENRON,Keith Holst/HOU/ECT@ectThank you so much for your time last week.David and I found the time especially valuable. We have spotted severalissues helpful for our own market.This should certainly help in the growth of our markets here in Europe. Wetrust it won't be too long before we see similarly impressive results fromour side of the pond.Best regardsAndy"

  "U.S. Soccer Presents": [
    "\"Center Circle\" (October 2001, Inaugural Issue)In this Inaugural Issue of U.S. Soccer's new monthly fan newsletter / e-zine, you'll find the items listed below. Some will return next month, others will be entirely fresh for November.1) Armchair Midfielder (MLS Playoffs)2) Word Association (w/ MNT defender Jeff Agoos)3) At the Movies (w/ U-17 MNT defenders Chris Lancos and Gray Griffin)4) Queries and Anecdotes (w/ WNT midfielder Julie Foudy)5) Big Woman on Campus (w/ WNT/U-21 WNT midfielder Aleisha Cramer)6) Superstar!!! (w/ WNT forward Tiffeny Milbrett)7) Mark That Calendar (2001 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup)8) Point-Counterpoint (w/ journalists Jere Longman and Steve Davis)9) From the Bleachers (w/ PHILIPS chant contest winner Randal Bird)10) \"You Don't Know Jack (Marshall)\" (U.S. Open Cup history)1) ARMCHAIR MIDFIELDERA monthly column about the State of Soccer, from the world game to Team America to pro soccer in the good &#8216;ole U-S-of-A, all with a healthy dose of cynicism.This month, the Armchair Midfielder will handicap the second round of the MLS playoffs and go on record with a pick for MLS Cup 2001 champion.So the defending champs are gone, and with them went their blase brand of defensive-minded soccer. MLS Cup will not be \"Goin' to Kansas City\" this year.  And let's face it, we as soccer fans are all better off with the Wizards watching the final from an Irish pub in downtown K.C.Instead, we get a classic (okay, the word is a bit of a leap considering MLS is just a toddler) match-up between the Galaxy and the Fire. Here are two teams that have been good every year that they've been in MLS. Sure, they've each had their ups and downs, but you can always count on them to play attractive soccer.\"BEHIND CLOSED DOORS\"2)  \"WORD ASSOCIATION\" (w/ Jeff Agoos)Jeff Agoos may or may not need some sort of therapy. Regardless, with 25 prompts on topics both easy and tough, we play psychiatrist to get a candid look inside the mind of San Jose Earthquakes star Jeff Agoos, one of the most accomplished defenders and one of the most enduring personalities in U.S. Soccer history.\"Goose\" has been a member of the U.S. Men's National Team program since 1985 and has the rare distinction of being the only men's player to compete on every major national team level offered by U.S. Soccer (U-15, U-17, U-20, Olympic, full Men's National Team and ... that's right, the game everyone loves to ignore ... Futsal). The 33-year-old veteran has won championships both at the college (at the Univ. of Virginia) and pro (D.C. United of MLS) levels and is currently being counted on to help the U.S. Men qualify for the 2002 World Cup after missing out on chances to play in both the 1994 and 1998 World Cups.Prompt ... ResponseDallas ... HomeMusic ... Rock n' rollPony Tail ... GooseStyle ... ArmaniBora Milutinovic [MNT coach 1991-95] ... TeacherSteve Sampson [MNT coach 1995-98] ... No commentBruce Arena [current MNT coach] ... Winner, motivator3) \"AT THE MOVIES\" (w/ U-17s Chris Lancos and Gray Griffin)Perhaps no U.S. team sees more movies than those precocious teenagers from the U.S. Under-17 Men's National team. Strip mall cinema connoisseurs Chris Lancos and Gray Griffin recount summer blockbuster \"American Pie 2\", a shining beacon of good taste and sophisticated humor. It should be noted that both players were accompanied by an adult (most likely U-17 MNT head coach John Ellinger or goalkeeper coach Peter Mellor) to the viewing of the aforementioned movie.4) \"QUERIES AND ANECDOTES\" (w/ Julie Foudy)Off-the-wall Questions and Answers, Queries and Anecdotes from the veteran U.S. WNT captain and jokester herself5) \"BIG WOMAN ON CAMPUS\" (w/ Aleisha Cramer)A monthly \"How's School?\" report from the campus of one of the many players on U.S. Youth National Teams who finds themselves cramming for exams in between U.S. training camps.This month, we get a page from the journal of BYU sophomore and Lakewood, Colo., native Aleisha Cramer, the U.S. Under-21 WNT veteran and rising star on the full U.S. Women's National Team.If you've ever been to Provo, Utah, you probably know that there is not a heck of a lot do.  But after over a year at BYU, I am starting to realize that the city and surrounding area has a lot to offer -- you just have to be creative.Still, most of my time during the college season is spent on the soccer field, traveling to the soccer field or coming back from the soccer field.  Oh yeah, our coach Jen Rockwood likes to have a lot of meetings too.  Basically, most of my day is taken by soccer and studying.But despite all the time dedicated to soccer, believe it or not, I do have a social life and I'm really enjoying college.  I have a great group of friends and we always have fun.  The coolest thing is that we have fun just doing nothing.  It's amazing that we can laugh as much as we do just hanging out.6) \"SUPERSTAR!!!\" (w/ Tiffeny Milbrett)A monthly feature about a U.S. Men's, Women's or Youth National Team player from the U.S. Soccer Communications Department.This month, we turn the big spotlight on all 5 feet 2 inches of superstar U.S. Women's National Team forward and WUSA Most Valuable Player Tiffeny Milbrett.\"Without Time For a Pit Stop, Forward Tiffeny Milbrett Powers Her Way to WUSA MVP Honors\"Like many young and successful professional athletes, Tiffeny Milbrett owns two cars.  And like many who love their cars, they reflect the owner in many ways.The first, a jet-black 2001 Chevrolet S10 4x4 pickup truck, which Milbrett received for being named the 2000 U.S. Soccer Chevrolet Female Player of the Year.  (She upgraded from a four-door.  Not her style). The truck represents the ruggedness of the five-foot-two Milbrett, who despite her small stature, has scored 86 career international goals, good for sixth best in world history.  It also represents the outdoors woman and adventurer that she is, a small-town Oregon girl who loves nature and travel, and who spent a good part of three years of her life in Japan playing professional soccer.Milbrett drives it like she plays, at a few gears higher than the rest, and hell-bent to get where she is going, which is usually the goal, a journey that is almost always successful.7) \"MARK THAT CALENDAR\" (2001 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final)A stern reminder about an upcoming U.S. Soccer event, whether you plan to check it out live and in person or on the tube.This year's title match is a first for both the Los Angeles Galaxy and the New England Revolution when it comes to the 88-year-old annual competition, which is open to all teams (amateur or pro) affiliated with U.S. Soccer and has made its mark as a ripe ground for inter-league upsets of David vs. Goliath.8) \"POINT-COUNTERPOINT\" (w/ journalists Jere Longman and Steve Davis)Every month, we'll pose a question or make a statement about something in soccer that will be debated on by two individuals from the same walk of life. Be it a coach, player, general manager, the two will each give their side of the story, so to speak.In this case, we've enlisted the help of two soccer journalists. In one corner, wearing a Mia Hamm replica jersey under his shirt and blue blazer ... Jere Longman, who covers international sport and the Olympics for the New York Times and whose extensive coverage of the 1999 Women's World Cup turned into a book about the U.S. Women's National Team entitled \"The Girls of Summer.\" In the other corner, wearing a worn-out replica of the now infamous U.S. Men's \"denim star\" jersey ... Steve Davis, a general columnist who's also been covering soccer for The Dallas Morning-News for over a decade and has covered the last two Men's World Cups.It is indisputable that the 1999 Women's World Cup had a greater impact on soccer in the United States than the 1994 men's World Cup.The Women's World Cup produced an American champion, and the American public loves a winner. In three weeks, without benefit of lavish pre-game shows or newspaper special sections, the Women's World Cup built a galvanizing momentum. It went from almost zero on the public radar to a consuming moment that drew over 90,000 fans to the final match against China at the Rose Bowl and attracted 40 million television viewers...World Cup 1994 changed all that. It was international soccer's coming out party in the United States. A land that respects the big event, the colossal show, began to see soccer as a sport it could learn to like.For soccer fans, it was their moment in the sun. More importantly in the big picture, Americans who wouldn't know a corner kick from a corner market tuned in to see what the fuss was about. Until the United States wins a World Cup, nothing else will be more influential in elevating the sport's domestic profile.9) \"FROM THE BLEACHERS\" (w/ PHILIPS Chant Contest winner Randal Bird)A monthly look at the fans behind the U.S. National Teams. In this case, one special fan by the name of Randal Bird has gone and made himself part of U.S. Soccer history as the author of the contest-winning Philips/U.S. Soccer chant that will hopefully be a part of international matches for years to come.GOALS!

Chanting to Your Heart's ContentWhen Philips Electronics joined U.S. Soccer in a partnership to help promote and develop the sport of soccer in the United States last June, their first order of business was launching a unique \"chant\" contest to challenge U.S. Soccer fans from all over the globe to log on to www.ussoccer.com and begin chanting to their hearts content.Of course, choosing a winning chant for which hundreds of fans would eventually be asked to latch on to as their own was never going to be easy.  Fans come in all different shapes and sizes.  And so do stadium chants.>From the long and melodic melodies of \"We all root for the red soccer team, the red soccer team, the red soccer team\" (as sung to the lyrics of Yellow Submarine) to the less melodic but rhythmic eloquence of a European chant like \"Stand up, if you hate Man U. ...  Stand up, if you hate Man U.\", they each have their own charm.10) \"YOU DON'T KNOW JACK (MARSHALL)\" (U.S. Open Cup history)Think you know your U.S. Soccer trivia? Well...try us. We'll see how far back your knowledge of Team USA and U.S. Soccer extends. And who the heck is Jack Marshall? Even the trivia buffs in the U.S. Soccer Communications Department would be hard pressed to tell you that one Jack Marshall received his one and only cap way back in 1926. Okay, that was pretty much impossible. They get easier. We give you four questions each month, 1 to 4, easy to hard.Answer #1 correctly, and it's safe to assume you haven't been stuck in a cave for the last five years.Answer #2 correctly, and you already know more about soccer than any anchor from \"SportsCenter\".Answer #3 correctly, you're probably pretty proud of yourself. Don't be. Try Question #4.If you answered #4 correctly, you are either N.Y. Daily News soccer writer Michael Lewis or you own a U.S. Soccer Media Guide.This month's trivia has to do with the annual, upset-friendly, \"knock-out\" tournament known as the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup.----------------------------------------------------------------------------"

    "PushkarI quickly plotted the short and the long curves and the following come out inyour face.1. Is this policy easing going to be a one shot ( a la 98 ) followed by aquick pick up in economic activity, or is this going to be a more deepersituation. That is the big one.  The curves vote for a small road-bump whichwill be rectified by a couple of eases over the next 6 months. Something theFed can handle easily and quickly. This is most likely NOT going to happen -this is not a 98 and things are going to play out differently.  There are anumber of other possibilities.2. The current slow-down is two pronged - capital spending slowdown frombusinesses ( especially on IT with the internet bust ) and the consumerspending slow-down , possibly because of the stock market wealth effect. Bothof these have already hit the durable goods section.  This reversal is 'Real'which takes longer to turn then the 'Financial crisis' hence there is goodpossibility we see a protraction of this weakness and even coupled with thefed eases this is going to take longer than six months to get better.3. The new administration is going to take this as a good opportunity toforce tax cuts. How does the Fed look at those ? Will the Fed balk and beless aggressive in the rate cuts expecting the tax cuts , will it ignorethem. That makes the equation harder. It also to some extent argues thatlonger term rates go up if these tax cuts materialize. But on the shorterterm who that effects Fed policy will have profound effect on the curve.All these favor a steeper curve. The 2-5 at -23 ( -6 on swap curve ), 2 -10at -15 ( 18 on the swaps ) and 2-30 at 19 bps ( 37 bp) should all be steeperas market realizes the length of this ease cycle.  If this cycle lasts anyear ( the final and the last ease happens next Dec ) then the 2-10 should be40 bp positive, as the market realizes that."

  "Update": [
    "Bob,Thank you for your reply.  I know you are doubly busy with your being on theroad this week, just prior to a vacation.  Your answer below is perfect!Bob, you and your team have been very supportive of our efforts to assist EBSwith BMC, and you have done all that we could have asked!  I wanted you toknow that we really appreciate your support (I especially do, as a \"latearrival\" to this situation)!  Thank you again for all of the help!JeffBob McAuliffe/ENRON@enronXgateCummins/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jenny Rub/Corp/Enron@EnronJeff,Assuming that either Randy or Doug were to decide that BMC was a viablesolution for their areas of responsibility, we would certainly supportpurchasing the appropriate products from BMC.Bob.-----Original Message-----Bob,I understand from Thais that you're on the road for Enron, but soon you'll be\"on the road for Bob\" - a well-deserved vacation coming up!  In light of yourimpending vacation, I wanted to do a quick follow-up check.If we could somehow, without causing an undesirable state in yourorganization, facilitate the ability to purchase BMC solution product for NetWorks, would you support that?I have spoken with Bruce Smith, Randy Matson, and Doug Cummins in followupcalls from the November 17th meeting in EB 22C1.  IF Randy and Doug werelikely to make a pro-BMC decision (instead of for a competitor's product),and IF there was a way to painlessly (for Net Works) enable the funds tobecome available to make a purchase of BMC product (by Net Works), would thatbe something you would support?  I am searching for a way to help EBS withoutimpacting Net Works in any negative way...but ultimately, I will abidewhatever you demand here.I hope to hear from you, either by telephone/voicemail, or e-mail; if youcould do so prior to your vacation.Thank you again for your help,Jeff YoungfleshJeff YoungfleshDirector, Business DevelopmentGlobal Strategic SourcingEnron Corp.333 Clay Street, 11th FloorHouston, TX 77002"

  "Update on BMC/EBS situation": [
    "Bob,I want to make sure I keep you in the loop on the EBS/BMC/NetWorks/GlobalStrategic Sourcing interactions.EBS has worked out an additional 25% discount, which brings the totaldiscount structure to Enron to a 45%-off pricing level, if EBS and Enronaggregate their spend opportunity.  This should come as good news to anyoneat Net Works who might be about to implement a BMC solution.Also, there is additional flexibility in the situation, in that BMC will bewilling to work with Enron business units with regard to the timing of theirsoftware purchases as it relates to applicability in EBS' deal.  For example,if Randy Matson's team chose the BMC solution at the conclusion of theircurrent testing, they could lock in the discount at 45% by sending an e-mail(or other form of written communication) committing to the purchase in 2001(the preference would be to get the \"buy\" done by end of 1st Qtr, ifpossible).  This would be sufficient commitment for BMC to go forward withtheir purchases of EBS' solutions currently proposed to BMC.I'm going to contact your leads (Randy, Bruce, et. al.) to let them know ofthe additional possible discount and the relative ease of securing it...andto also help make sure that what BMC is pricing out to all is the correctapplication solution in each instance.Thank you for your help and cooperation,Jeff Youngflesh"

This was the second meeting that was held to discuss thisidea.  Represented were the CAISO, APS, PNM, TEP, EPE, TNP, APSES,NewEnergy, Enron, Calpine, PG&E Gen, Southern, Duke, Cal PX, and DOE.The issues that were discussed included the CAISO's ability to implementthe major components of the DSTAR commercial model, the changes thatwould need to be made in the CAISO's governance and internal structure,and costs.consolidating the existing control areas into a single control area assoon as possible, (ii) migrating to a common set of market protocols ona fairly rapid basis, (iii) creating a single, independent, RTOgoverning board with no bias in favor of either California or the DesertSouthwest region, and (iv) migrating from a regional advisory committeestructure to a single advisory committee structure as soon as possible,to avoid balkanization and accelerate convergence.  Most parties feltthat there were, at this time, no \"show-stoppers\" on most of the issues.For many of the participants, the most significant outstanding questionsparties would incur under the consolidation scenario, and (ii) timing -i.e., whether the necessary implementation, governance andorganizational changes could be put into place by a target date of June2001.It was agreed that the next step was for the CAISO, working withinterested parties, to provide a tentative implementation cost (bothwith and without consolidation of DSW control areas, but in both caseswith independent procurement and operation of ancillary services).enable it to develop a cost estimate5 meetingquestionsthe scenario(s) that they desire the CAISO to consider in developing itscost estimateadditional questions, and discuss the viability and possible contents ofa Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)move forwardfinalization of an MOU which would address the commitments of theparties, market structure, changes in governance, organizational goals,priorities and structures, etc.has sent a list of technical questions to Carl Imparato and he iscompleting a response.

  "Update on Retention & Severance Plan": [
    "We know how interested all of you are in the Retention & Severance Plan, so we want to update you on its status.As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22.  We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month.We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave.  We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed.  We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed.The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns.  The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan.  Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy.  These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate.The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process.  To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee.  We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible.  This is currently our top priority, bar none!When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be.  Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place.We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation.  The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved.  That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse.We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan.  We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court.  We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court.With respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future.In the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week.And of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible."

    "Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as \"taxable\" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as \"imputed tax\".

    "Vince J KaminskiSchwieger/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT@ECTJohn,We have  been working for the last few days on VaR related issues.The focus is on Jim Schwieger's  storage book as of 5/25 and 5/26where we had some counterintuitive results. This book is a goodcandidate for a systematic review of the VaR process.It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaRsystem. You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulativebasis,jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position.This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing abigjump in VaR.This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. Please, lookat column D.a. a bug in the code. We are working with the person in IT who wrote thecode to review it.b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity inthe fwd vol curve will do it). One solution I canpropose, is to develop forthe traders a fwd-fwd vol generator  allowing them toreview the fwd vol curvebefore it is posted. If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol,it can be smoothed.Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings?Vince"

Can you please attach a time schedule to the differentsteps and send it back.Thanks,JohnKaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECTGentlemen,Below is a plan of action for moving along with the VaR methodology change1. Finalize the methodology proposed (Research/Market Risk)- determine the time period used to calculated forward-forward vols vs.correlations (20 days vs. 60 days)- stabilize the calculation for curves and time periods where the curve doesnot change based on historical prices, implying volatility of 0%2. Get approval for the methodology change from Rick Buy (see draft of thememo attached) - John Lavorato and John Sherriff3. Develop and implement the new methodology in a stage environment(Research/IT)4. Test the new methodology (Market Risk, Traders)5. Migrate into production (Research/IT)Please let me know if this is reasonable and meets everyone's expectations.Vlady."

This means for d>0, say, d = 1.2, it is mapped to 1;  for d<0, say d= -1.2, it is mapped to -1.5.b) if d is greater than the maximum scalar in the curve, it is mapped to the maximum scalar, 1.5 in this example.c) if d is less than the smallest scalar in the curve, it is mapped to the smallest scalar, -1.5 in this example.2.

When I started this gig, I was theonly guy in town writing to folks like you about the power industry inCalifornia.  I wrote about what?s new, what?s happening, and all theimportant stuff.  This week, Governor Gray Davis decided to write hisown Burrito.  His epistle got more press than mine, but why is hemuscling in on my turf?  Not to be outdone, PUC President Loretta Lynchreleased a report which looks into every facet of California?s powerbusiness.  No stone left unturned. I?m telling you, there isn?t enoughroom in this business for all of us.  They need to clear out.With people like Herr (Hair?) Peace, Governor I?m-Not Mr.-Rogers Davisand Let?s Do Lynch, who needs a Friday Burrito?  They re-define ourreality each week with mind-numbing aplomb.  For example, starting inearly June, the PX was ordered to compete for business against otherQualified Trading Vehicles.  Then, two weeks later, the Energy F_hrerlegislated that idea to an early death which kept the status quo for atleast one year.  This week the PUC approved 5-year bilateral deals forPG&E and SCE, thereby opening the PX to competition, and emasculatingthe PX?s Block Forward Market. Zip, bam, boom.I can?t wait to see what next week will bring.  I hear Senator Bowen isholding Committee hearings on re regulating the industry, and theWhat?s for lunch?Who will sit at the head of the table?Does anyone have good seats for next week?s Democratic convention?Is there anyone we haven?t indicted yet in the power industry?Who will crank up the air conditioning in this room?  It?s getting toowarm.Then, they will collect data from innocent businesses under subpoena,ignore the facts, and publish a report.  It makes one want to take adeep breath, and inhale the scented fumes of democracy.You know, I can?t think about where to begin, so let?s start somewhere.>>> Things on the Island of California@@@ Is there anyone left at SDG&E with a brain?@@@ The PUC issues its scathing report@@@ The ISO invokes $250 price caps.  Duh!>>> Things at the throne of FERC@@@ Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order>>> Odds and Ends (_!_)>>> Things on the Island of California@@@ Is there anyone left at SDG&E with a brain?Well, the answer very clearly is no.  I have been astounded by repeatedattempts of SDG&E?s most senior people to ape humans, but instead theymimic apes.Consider the following.  First, they waltz their default customers intothe summer with little of no protection from price spikes in thewholesale market.  Forgivable in that it is human to err.  The pricesskyrocket in June, and they start looking for who to blame.  _Must bethem damn independent generators,O say their managers.  Gary Cottoninforms the ISO Governing Board that hedging SDG&E?s position in theBlock Forward Market wouldn?t have made any difference.  There?s onenobel laureate who missed his prime.Next, under pressure, they ask for help from suppliers and anyone elsewho will assist the utility and their customers.  Nine offers show up attheir table, and they can?t choose any of them.  Again, Mr Cotton tellshis fellow ISO Governing Board members that these things take time, andwe don?t to rush since there are many legislative barriers, and, well,the surfing was good this week so why spoil it?Now they are in a panic because the Energy F_hrer is visiting old ladiesliving in trailer parks, advising them not to pay their SDG&Eelectricity bill, and to continue to operate their air conditioners.SDG&E puts a full page ad in the local newspaper telling everyone thatSDG&E is doing everything it can to lower their electric bills,including asking the ISO for a $250 price cap, but the public can helpby calling the ISO [address and phone number provided in the ad] andurging them to lower the cap.  I always thought the location of the ISOwas a State secret for security reasons.  No secrets in San Diego.But we are not done.  No sir, we are not.  Those buffalo heads who runthat company decide they will win a gold star on their collectiveforeheads, and implement one of the four resolutions passed by theElectric Oversight Board.  The one they pick is to petition FERC on anexpedited basis to cap at $250, the price at which sellers may bidenergy or ancillary services into the ISO and the PX.  The primaryreason is that Western power markets are not workably competitive.  Inother words, they want FERC to set a max price on what generators cansell in addition to the price limit at which the ISO can buy!What I find most astounding about this double talk is that SDG&Econtinues to collect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must runenergy into the PX.   These are sales from their stranded assets.  Theirgrief hasn?t abated their greed.So, to recap, SDG&E missed the boat on price hedging, failed to winconsumer confidence in public meetings, asked for help from suppliersand did nothing in response, then filed at FERC to cap the sale pricebecause the wholesale market into which they sell (over-priced?) energyis not workably competitive.  Too much time in the direct sun light.>>> Things on the Island of California@@@ The PUC issues its scathing reportThe PUC report released yesterday is a gem with which I have not spentenough time.  I only read the Executive Summary, and that only becauseour counsel, Dan Douglass forwarded me a copy. Let me pick out some ofthe gems in President Lets Do Lynch?s burrito.  I would recommendreading the whole text if you have time, and if you seek perverseentertainment._California is experiencing major problems with electricity supply andpricing caused by policies and procedures adopted over the past tenyears._ Since June, wholesale prices for electrical power in California haveincreased on average 270% over the same period in 1999, resulting inover $1 billion in excess   payments for electricity._Hot weather, aging power plant and transmission infrastructure, anddysfunctional bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets combinedto drive prices up ..._Because of serious market defects and tight supply of electricity,purchasers of California power will likely pay billions more inelectricity costs this year. Moreover, these price increases do notnecessarily fund new investments in electricity supply or deliveryreliability - they may flow solely to power producer profit margins._Despite the Electricity Oversight Board's legislative mandate tooversee those institutions, we have been unable to obtain [bid] data.Nevertheless, ... , we believe enough evidence of questionable behaviorexists that the Attorney General should conduct an investigation intothese statewide market practices, coordinating with other Stateagencies, including the PUC and the EOB. Such an investigation wouldprovide the factual foundation that California policy makers andregulators need to recover any illegally obtained profits._A momentous consequence of California's attempt to create a market inelectricity is that the federal government now regulates California'selectric system. Washington D.C. now controls pricing decisions directlyat the wholesale level and indirectly at the retail level and, to theextent that supply incentives are correlated to prices, Washington, D.C.now affects California's ability to attract new investment in powerplants._Past administrations' willingness to cede the State's authority to thefederal government combined with the legislative creation of twonon-public supervisory organizations that have no duty to protect thepublic or consider the retail customer. The \"Independent SystemOperator\" (ISO) and the \"Power Exchange\" (PX), the nonprofit privatecorporations that operate the State's transmission system and controlwholesale pricing policies, are governed by boards whose members canhave serious conflicts of interest. Some of these board members or theircompanies financially benefit from higher prices in electricity markets.Neither of these private organizations is accountable to the State orits consumers ...._Despite the federalization and the fragmentation of the State'selectric services, the State of California should protect its businessesand consumers from cartel pricing; collusive behavior; inadequate powerplant maintenance and lack of market planning for adequate electricitysupplies._California consumers and businesses deserve to know in advance - as SanDiegans did not this summer - how and when the price of an essentialservice like electricity will double. California is now largelyconstrained by federal mandates from providing comprehensive retailprice relief as long as wholesale prices remain so high. If Californiatried to re-impose a price freeze in San Diego now, federal regulatorswould likely prevent that action.  ... Short-term price relief, however,cannot resolve market gaming or fundamental wholesale pricing problemscontrolled by federal regulators._We have been precluded from obtaining the data necessary to know ifthe ISO and PX failed to detect manipulation and gaming on severalfronts. We do not know how market players acted in price offering andbidding and scheduling. The FERC has just announced an inquiry intonational pricing and energy market issues. California should not waitfor national findings before it investigates California marketpractices. We recommend that the California Attorney General immediatelysubpoena relevant records and data to determine the pricing and offeringbehavior of market participants; the actions of the ISO and its boardmembers; and the actions of generators in supplying California's energyneeds._Ten Actions to Consider or Act Upon to Prevent Current Electricity2. Create a California Energy Council, modeled on the NationalSecurity Council, to unify State action to resolve energyproblems and to perform integrated energy planning;3. Ask FERC for extended wholesale price cap authority tomoderate California wholesale market pricing;4. Ask FERC to recognize the defects in the California andwestern regional markets and find that no competitive marketexists in California power markets;...8. Eliminate potential conflicts of interest in ISO/PXstakeholder boards;9. Improve California's ability to obtain ISO and generatordata and enhance the State's enforcement capability for powerplant maintenance; price manipulation and generation gaming,consistent with protection of proprietary businessinformation;10. Provide the EOB with effective enforcement ability andadditional oversight authority for the ISO and PX.4. Streamline state power plant siting procedures; consistentwith environmental requirements, and prioritize applicationsto advance clean, BACT+ power plant proposals.5. Institute \"use-it -or- lose-it\" permitting power plantlicensing and emissions credits rules to ensure power plantsget built;...8. Reform PX pricing protocols and structures to lowerwholesale and retail prices and reduce excess profitsOI told you I don?t need to write a Burrito anymore.  The Democrats inSacramento are doing that for me.  Welcome comrade.>>> Things on the Island of California@@@ The ISO invokes $250 price caps.  Duh!It is really hard to describe the drama of an ISO Governing Boardmeeting, especially when our favorite topic arises.  It seems the onlytime the Board becomes animated is when one of three issues are on theOtherwise, its pretty much hum-drum.%Round and %round we went, once again.  A few more forced votes tippedthe scale in favor of the cap.  There were 15 yes votes, which includeda forced yes vote from our friend Jerry Toenyes by order of Secretary ofEnergy Mr. Richardson. [Jerry, did you realize that the last letters ofyour name could be re-arranged to spell _NO ET YESO?  Kind of a frenchthing.] I?m sorry about that vote, Jerry.  You still go in my book asone of the brave and bold for standing up to that sort of intimidationfor so long.  Your picture in the SF Chron said it all.The brave souls who stood tall and voted NO included David Parquet(Enron), Jan Smutny-Jones (IEP), Barbara Barkovich (CLECA), CaolynKehrein (CMA), Dan Kirshner (EDF), and Stacy Roscoe (Procter & Gamble).Now, I must admit that Dynegy?s Greg Blue did help by voting a Texas No,spelled _A-B-S-T-A-I-NO.   I have instructed Dynegy trader Dave Francisin Houston to work with Greg to correct that problem.  We?re going towork things out.The Energy F_hrer addressed the Board, again.  I didn?t mind that I onlyhad a few brief, very brief moments to address the Board, and Herr(Hair?) Peace got over 20 minutes.  That didn?t bother me at all.  Hedid more damage to himself in 20 than I could do in 2.  He blasted awayat everyone who opposed him.  He pined about Camden quitting the Board.He said he knew how prices and markets work, that it isn?t the way thoseacademic egg-head, FERC-loving economists tell you who pray to the godsof competition.  He lambasted WAPA for withholding generation to protectfish and wildlife (what was that all about?).  He predicted that onThursday?s PUC meeting he and all the other powerful Democrats,Republicans and angry citizens of San Diego would demand that the PUCimpose a rate cap on retail electric rates in San Diego that are justand reasonable (it didn?t happen).  And on and on and on.  This man isvery delusional. He believes that Steve, and only Steve Peace can savethe world.  He believes that political will trumps judicial,quasi-judicial, or independent Board actions.  This man makes relevantall the abstract musings of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche(1844-1900) ... The will to power, the ?bermensch, the transvaluation ofvalues, etc.But we are getting under (uber?) his skin, with the help of the press.Wednesday afternoon I called Commissioner Dick Bilas to see if hethought whether the next day?s PUC meeting was going to be a roll over.Dick said he got a call from Peace, and that Peace said he would notcome to the meeting.  Apparently, Peace had received a lot of press, andall of it bad.That?s the thin line of freedom which keeps tyranny at least one stepaway from our front door.>>> Things at the throne of FERC@@@ Amen for the Morgan Stanley OrderAnd now, the good news.  You deserve this.  FERC gave the Californiamarket a little wiggle room last Friday.  FERC issued a last minutereply to the complaint by Morgan Stanley Capital Group relating to theISO?s intent to lower the price cap.  FERC denied the complaint, butthey didn?t waste time with an Order to simply deny a complaint.  FERCdanced on the head of the ISO and pulled the bite out of the price cap._We accepted this [Amendment 21], not because it was a cap on sellers?prices but because it would promote order and transparency in the marketby clearly telling sellers of the maximum price the ISO was willing topay and allowing sellers to make informed economic choices on whether tosell in the ISO market or to sell elsewhere..._ ... The ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energythan any other buyer of these services ... If the ISO is unable toelicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase priceceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose),it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meetits needs. ... Therefore, an increase in out-of-market (OOM) calls forgeneration may be necessary to maintain system reliability.  Because thecurrent payment for OOM is not subject to a maximum purchase price, theresulting overall payments may be higher._To the extent the ... ISO Board resolution contemplates implementing adirective that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO marketsunder any circumstances (e.g., when system load exceeds 38,000 MW), sucha requirement is not permitted by our ... Order and the ISO tariff. ...Future implementation of the ISO Board resolution with regard to arequirement to sell would require significant revisions to the ISOmarket rules.  Such market changes could not become effective absent acorresponding amendment to the ISO tariff which would have to be filedunder section 205 of the FPA.OWell. What do you think about that?Just wait.  Here is what the sleeping bear, Commissioner Hebert said in_Getting to the bottom of the problem, in my view, requires us to begina proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as the operator of theCalifornia grid.  The record supports such a move. ... A memorandum tothe ISO from a stakeholder who resigned from the governing boardeloquently brings to our attention repeated attempts to undermine theindependence of the ISO. The memorandum also thoughtfully outlinesconsequences to the markets of a return to %command and control.?_Because these allegations come from a non-market participant,especially should we take heed.  We must also take notice of the publicpressure on the Board to compromise its independence.OAmen, brother, amen.>>> Odds and Ends (_!_)As you can imagine, this week, like an endless string of weeks beforethis has been interminable.  I get about three phone calls a day frompress reporters, very little of which ever sees print.  My shtick isjust too complex for casual readers.  But I do notice that the reportersare asking better questions.  The public is becoming more savvy.  Theinformation flow is moving in our favor, and will disarm the forces ofevil, in about 10 years.I have other problems on my mind.  I am working on a new computersystem.  Really, it?s just an upgrade of an older computer that is a bitfaster than the laptop I tried to upgrade, very unsuccessfully.  As aresult of the all the new hardware and software I purchased, my officelooks like a war zone with an odd mix of PUC service copies, computerdocumentation, and diskettes laying all around. Quite a mess.Prepare for the future.  Our next general meeting is scheduled forThursday and Friday, October 5 and 6 at Moro Bay.  Barb Ennis willprepare a blurb for us in next week?s Burrito about room reservations,timing, golf, etc.  Our guest speakers will include MSC ChairmanProfessor Frank Wolak who will talk on the subject of his choice, Ms.Irene Moosen of Grueneich Resource Advocates who will make apresentation on the distributed generation case before the PUC, andWilliam Freddo of PG&E National Energy Group who will give us someeducation on operating a power plant inside the New England ISO.Now for your daily bread, provided this week by Dan Douglass.  Last weekwe had a joke about Catholics.  This week it?s agnostics.=====================An atheist was taking a walk thru the woods, admiring all that theaccident  of evolution had created.  \"What majestic trees!  Whatpowerful rivers! What  beautiful animals!\"  he said to himself.As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushesbehind him.  As he turned to look, he saw a 7 foot grizzly bearcharging  towards him. He ran as fast as he could up the path.  Helooked over his  shoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on him.He tried to run even  faster, so scared that tears were coming to hiseyes. His heart was pumping  frantically as he tried to run even faster,but he tripped and fell on the  ground.  He rolled over to pick himselfup and saw the bear right on top of  him raising its paw to kill him.At that instant he cried out \"Oh my God!\" And time stopped. The bearfroze.  The forest was silent.  The river even stopped flowing.  Abright light shone  upon the man, and a voice out of the sky said, \"Youdeny my existence all  these years, teach others I don't exist and evencredit my creation to a  cosmic accident, and now do you expect me tohelp you out of this  predicament?  Am I to count you as a believer?\"The atheist, ever so proud, looked into the light and said, \"It would berather hypocritical to ask to be counted as a believer after all theseyears,  but could you make the bear a believer?\"\"Very well\" said the voice. And the light went out, the river flowed,the  sounds of the forest continued, and the bear brought both pawstogether,  bowed his head, and said, \"Lord, I thank you for this foodwhich I am about  to receive.\"==================Amen.  And have a great weekend.  Oh, and thanks to all of you who sentme happy birthday wishes.  It was very much appreciated.KSBgba- att1.htm"

  "WPTF Friday Credo Veritas Burrito": [
    "THE FRIDAY BURRITO\"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate.\"There is a hint of Autumn in the air.  I don=0F't know if it=0F's wishfulthinking, or if the seasons are really beginning to turn from our palesummer into a Bay Area glorious Fall.  It=0F's premature, I know.  A fewfallen leaves, the start of schools, slightly longer afternoon shadows... I=0F'm jumping the gun.  I can=0F't wait for this summer to be over,especially this summer.  The pounding never stops, and as I hear the dinof the cash register ringing with each climb in Southwest temperature, IMontana restricting transmission paths, blown up interstate gas pipelinein New Mexico, diminishing N-Ox credits for in-state power plants,depleted inventory of hours of voluntary load interruptions forcommercial and industrial customers, credit limits restricting importsof Canadian power into the Northwest and California, and BPA buyingabout 1,000 MW to cover its short hydro position.I also get the willies every time another politician lambastes theCalifornia restructured power industry.  I just want to end to thesummer, now, and start a two week Fall vacation ... anywhere, even inCleveland.There are seven, count them, seven investigations into some aspect ofthe wholesale power market out here.  Two days ago there were only six,but FERC just added another yesterday in response to the Prez=0F'srequest.  That means FERC has two, the PUC has two, the State AttorneysGeneral has two (one on the ISO Governing Board, and one on the in-stategenerators), and one by the Electric Oversight Board.  If you don=0F't havean ongoing study of the California Market, then you=0F're not hip.All of these investigations, save FERC=0F's Section 206 Investigation, aregoing to amount to near nothing.  A lot of wasted time and paper.  ThePUC and EOB studies have their conclusion sections all finished.  Nowthey need some evidence to support their assertions.And how are we holding up under all of this?  How are you doing?  I talkto many of you throughout the week, and I know how frustrated you are.I share your frustration.  You want to tell the public, the press, andanyone in between the truth.  You want to lay out the facts.  You wantto show anyone who will listen that each interference into the market ismaking things worse, not better.  The price caps, for example, aredamnable and screwing up the prices, much to the detriment of thosepeople for who price caps were supposed to be a protection against priceshocks.  Now they are receiving higher average prices.The public isn=0F't going to listen to anything longer than a sound bite.And let=0F's face it, when it comes to stellar public relations, ourindustry is not known for turning in A+ performances, except for SCE.Those guys seem to get their story in front of the public at everyturn.  I heard SCE is putting on their customers=0F' bill, =0F\"Here is whatyou would have paid if the rate freeze ended ....=0F\".  But many of us inthe new power industry, borne from the loins of either the natural-gasindustry or nuclear-power business, learned the hard way that the bestresponse to a public inquiry is a two-block head start in front of anangry mob.  Keep your head down, shut your mouth, and this too shallpass.I don=0F't buy that approach, at least not anymore.  That is, I don=0F'tbelieve we have anything to hide, or of which to be ashamed.  Whatelectric restructuring is about is correct, beneficial to the public,and in everyone=0F's best interests.  Look at it this way, when they patthe last shovelful of dirt on your final resting place, for what do youmost want to be remembered?  That you caved in to the political will ofothers, or at a moment when you had the chance, you did what was rightinstead of what was expedient?  I think the choice is easy, albeit lacedwith sheer terror.  Those bland homilies I so diligently teach my kids(e.g., tell the truth, do what is right, think of the big picture andnot just yourself) are a lot easier to speak than to live by.  So joinme and stand up for what you believe.  They can=0F't take away your pride,not yet.Here is this week=0F's line up.>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California@@@ Excerpts from FERC=0F's Order on SDG&E Complaint@@@ The Development of a Super-Peak Block Energy Product>>> Odds and Ends (_!_)@@@ Finish the Story Contest@@@ October General Meeting@@@ What Makes Houston, Houston?>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California@@@ Excerpts from FERC=0F's Order on SDG&E ComplaintPresident Clinton commented from the Rose Garden that good folks in SanDiego, retired, fixed-income, likely to vote for a Democrat, are makingchoices between buying medicine or air conditioning their homes.  I callthis the Del Monica Beach lecture.  The Prez instructed the FERC toinvestigate the situation in California, and FERC wasted no time.In response to SDG&E=0F's August 2 complaint, whereby the utility askedFERC to impose a $250 price cap on generators in the region, the FERCresponded in a way that I was hoping to see several months ago.  TheFERC slammed SDG&E on their complaint for lack of merit, and the FERCalso initiated an FPA Section 206 Investigation into the wholesale powermarket in California.=0F\"In this order, ... , we are denying SDG&E's requested immediateimposition of a price cap on all sellers in California.  However, we areinstituting consolidated hearing   proceedings pursuant to section 206of the Federal Power Act to investigate the justness and reasonablenessof the rates and charges of public utilities that sell energy andancillary services to or through the California ISO and PX, and to alsoinvestigate whether the tariffs and institutional structures and bylawsof the California ISO and PX are adversely affecting the efficientoperation of competitive wholesale electric power markets in Californiaand need to be modified=0F\"SDG&E concludes that the markets cannot be workably competitive ifsellers are able to exact prices that are considerably above levels thatwould prevail in open competition, i.e., sellers are able to bid andreceive prices significantly above their marginal costs.  SDG&E alsoargues that the hour-to-hour volatility in imbalance energy prices andthe erratic clearing price for ancillary services is an indication thatthe market is breaking down when it is moderately stressed.=0F\"While we find it appropriate to institute a section 206 hearing onthese issues, we cannot implement an immediate price cap of $250/MWh asrequested by SDG&E because there is no record before us to support suchan action.  ...  While the issues raised by this complaint areimportant, the Commission has no basis to conclude that SDG&E's proposalto place an immediate, arbitrary $250/MWh cap on the price that everypublic utility seller of energy and ancillary services may bid into thePX and ISO markets would satisfy this standard.  SDG&E has provided noevidence to demonstrate that all potential sellers are able to exercisemarket power, has not documented a single instance of a sellerexercising market power during times of scarcity, and did not attempt toshow that the conditions underlying the Commission's approval ofmarket-based rates for public utility sellers of energy and ancillaryservices have changed.  Nor did it address specific market orinstitutional  factors that may be causing rates to be unjust orunreasonable.=0F\"SDG&E asserts that the ISO's congestion management and marketstructures are flawed and in need of overhaul. ... Furthermore, SDG&Eexpresses its concern that, for a number of reasons, the congestionmanagement and market reform efforts being pursued by ISO stakeholderswill not produce  meaningful results.  SDG&E indicates that it isprepared to work with the ISO to develop alternative reform proposals;however, SDG&E's complains that the ISO stakeholder process has, inSDG&E's judgment, been ineffective with respect to these issues.=0F\"Various interveners contend that SDG&E's arguments are premature. ...We agree with Interveners. ...  The reform efforts have been the subjectof extensive public review and comment and are nearing completion.Accordingly, we reject SDG&E's arguments at this time.=0F\"It is unclear whether SDG&E's failure to purchase hedging instrumentsfor its retail operations is due to state regulatory policies or itsbusiness decisions.  A retail rate design that exposes consumers to thevolatility of commodity prices would be extraordinary, particularly whenconsumers do not have the ability to receive or respond to pricesignals.=0F\"We are concerned that ... increasing level of market activity in thereal-time market raises significant reliability and economical concerns....  Historically, the ISO procures on a daily basis only the resourcesneeded for the operating day.  Not only does this procurement practiceput pressure on the grid operator to secure needed resources at the lastminute, but the practice is uneconomical.  Such spot-market purchasesare not subject to the ISO's  buyer's cap.  Furthermore, because the ISOis the supplier of last resort for these services, when OOM calls aremade, suppliers realize that the ISO is in a must-buy situation.=0F\"In an effort to address this problem, we direct the ISO to immediatelyinstitute a more forward approach to procuring the resources necessaryto reliably operate the grid.  Specifically, the ISO should anticipatethe need for such additional resources based on  forecasted peakperiods.  We direct the ISO to factor these reforms into an analysis ofthe need for and level of purchase price caps and to include thisanalysis as support for any filing it makes to extend its purchase pricecap authority.=0F\"In closing, WPTF is an intervenor in the case, and we hope to be veryactive in the case through testimony, cross examination, the filing ofbriefs, and reply briefs.>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California@@@ The Development of a Super-Peak Block Energy ProductSeveral weeks ago, I discussed with the ISO their interest in developinga new market for a block energy product that would be purchased in themorning of a trade day, and be dispatched during the super-peak hours.I challenged them to let the market participants develop this marketinstead of the ISO doing the same.At the August 1 ISO Governing Board meeting, I stated as the WPTFposition that we oppose price caps, but if the ISO Governing Boardinsisted on going down the $250/MWH price cap route, we would do whatever we could to help the situation and avoid the occurrences of Stage 3alerts.  Whereas I didn=0F't think about the conversation on super-peakblock markets as being relevant to  the remarks before the GoverningBoard, it became painfully clear soon after that we could, and shouldwork with the ISO to develop a new market through either APX or theCalifornia PX, or both, to bring some order to the otherwise chaotic Outof Market system.This week, WPTF and the ISO had a joint meeting whereby both sidesdiscussed the merits of a super-peak block firm-energy product, and howit could be instituted.  The meeting at the ISO, at which WPTF had manyof its members who either have generation in the State, or import powerinto California, was for market participants and the ISO to discuss howto bring more order and price transparency to the ISO's out of marketcalls. The ISO reported that this summer, to date, the amount of moneyspent on Out of Market purchases was about $100 million.  Last year thetotal cost of Out of Market purchases was $1.7 million.APX and CalPX, in response to our earlier discussions with them,presented their proposals at the meeting.  The discussions which ensuedduring the course of the presentations focused on how the ISO mightutilize a product/service to reduce the manpower requirements currentlyneeded to satisfy its out of market telephone calls, typically on shortnotice, and the interest on the part of market participants to make bidsinto either the APX or CalPX's proposed system for a super-peakfirm-energy product.There were no  commitments made by any party, simply a willingness towork together to alleviate the problems associated with findingsufficient electric power during high demand periods with greatertransparency, more participants, and greater market efficiency.We=0F'll keep you posted on our development of this market.Sometimes I share bites of our Burrito with fellow travellers, much as Idid last week when I sent my friend Mike Florio a copy of the storycalled the Trial of Gow Jing.  Mike sent me a note that I would like toshare. He said I could.  I want you to read it and appreciate that thereare other people who share his view.  I also copied the response I sentto Michael, a.k.a. Old Deuteronomy.=0F\"I'm not going to attempt to complete your little melodrama [theGow-Jing story], but I did want to offer an observation.  In simplertimes, people knew the other people that they did business with, andthey typically lived in the same community.  If a merchant tried tocharge exorbitant prices for his products, even if he was the only onein town who had the product in stock, he would face the wrath of hisfellow citizens.  This undoubtedly served as a constraint on suchbehavior, even in the absence of a CPUC or FERC. Telling Mrs. Jones thatthe loaf of bread she needs to feed her kids will cost her $50 would notbe a pleasant way to do business, and such things ordinarily did nothappen.=0F\"In the modern global economy, of course, this personal aspect of doingbusiness has been almost completely lost.  And so has the restraint.  Ihave no doubt that the folks who sell electricity are good people (jeez,I know many of them), but they work in an environment where the endresults of their business decisions are invisible.  If Mrs. Jones can'tafford to run her refrigerator any more, that fact is at best dimlyperceived, and if so it is viewed as cause for some sort of socialprogram, not a reason why a merchant would alter his behavior.=0F\"This is clearly not a case of socialism versus capitalism, because bothscenarios occur within the overall context of a capitalist system.  Butcertainly something fundamental has changed, and not for the better inmy view.  Now everyone feels compelled to squeeze the last dollar out ofevery transaction-- their jobs may even depend upon it-- and no one isresponsible for the end result.  Is this the kind of world we want tolive in???=0F\"PUT THAT IN YOUR BURRITO AND SEE WHAT YOUR READERS SAY!  YOU CAN EVENBLAME ME, SO THAT YOU ARE NOT ACCUSED OF TURNING PINK IN YOUR MIDDLEAGE.      Deut=0F\"Okay.  It=0F's in the Burrito.  And here is what I think.You allude to the change in a world that was once =0F\"more personal=0F\" and=isnow institutional.  You make the point that things are not better off iffor no other reason then the lack of personal accountability.  But Idon=0F't think that in all cases the more personal world is lost.  It isever present, as I will argue below.  Second, your group embraces theimpersonal =0F\"efficiencies=0F\" when it is convenient.  Finally and mostimportantly, where will your social-minded and like minded counterpartsbe when competitive forces leap supply ahead of demand, which mighthappen in a handful of years?However, your essential point is not lost on me.  I do believe thatthere are ways for generators and consumers to be good neighbors inCalifornia.  I have a proposal below to which I would like to hear yourresponse.First, though, the personal business touch is present in our economy.  Iexercise the restraint to which your story pines in many of myconsulting engagements which require financial give and take betweenclient and vendor.  It is simply smart business to do so.  I have beenthe beneficiary of the same with my local bank when errors occurred inmy checking accounts, or when loan payments were made absent mindedlylate, etc., and the late fee forgiven.  However, much of our economy,and certainly the trade of a commodity such as electricity requires theuse of markets.  Nameless and faceless, they do squeeze out all theefficiencies which lead to lower prices, more innovation, and a sharingof price risk with parties who are neither the ultimate consumer nor theinitial producer.  The producer and consumer get out of the riskarbitrage and leave it to others who are more skilled and monied.I find it ironic that TURN, then, is so insistent on arguing, as it hasdone on many many occasions for the relaxation of market separation inthe ISO=0F's congestion management reform.  Elimination of marketseparation is nothing more than the impersonal forcing of parties toexecute trades on either side of a congested transmission path in thename of market efficiency.  Lower prices for consumers.  Does it reallymatter if it is done through person to person transactions, or throughmarkets?Third, your story can be used to make an alternative point.  Whathappens to the merchant in town when Wal-Mart moves into the next towndown the road?  All the faithful customers that your Merchant ofVengeance was protecting suddenly migrate to a competitor with greaterinventory, more choice, and lower prices.  What do you say, then?  Thecorollary for us is direct.  The new generation owners moved literallybillions of dollars into California, at risk, and took a chance.  Itpaid off.  They succeeded as we all know this year, and probably willnext year, and so on.  But the 3,000 MW of new power plants underconstruction in California, and the 3,000 MW under construction inArizona, and the over 16,000 MW of combined power projects inCalifornia, Arizona, and Southern Nevada that are in line for permitswill change the financial landscape in a hurry once energized.  Theprices will soften, returns will be less cherry, and I really want toknow, where will today=0F's accusers be when there is a shake out?Consumers will reap that benefit, oh you best believe it. But thealliances to which your opening story alludes simply misses that point.You gotta make hay while the sun shines.Now to my proposal.   Michael, I would be willing to work with you todevelop some kind of loan program for residential and small commercialcustomers that would, in effect, reduce the economic hardship of higherelectricity prices.  I could imagine, although I haven=0F't tested the ideawith any parties,  that a significant program could be crafted, possiblysecured by the credit of participating generating companies, andexecuted by a commercial lending institution such as Bank of America.Borrowers would pay a fair interest rate and the administrative fees.It=0F's simply smart business, not charity.  It=0F's one way to amortize th=eearnings which came about due to a circumstance of short supply relativeto the sudden growth of demand for power.Maybe that is a step in the right direction, I don=0F't know. One couldargue that it is no different than SDG&E implementing a level paymentplan for it=0F's consumers.  True, it is no different, because in eithercase the customer is paying for the loan interest and administrativefees, and I consistently believe that a market for credit is moreefficient (am I getting impersonal?) than one instituted by amonopoly.   Second, the security for these loans is provided by partiesother than the utility=0F's customers.  Further, we wouldn=0F't have to wor=ryabout PUC oversight and prudence reviews.  We could make this workquickly.I will be very interested to hear your thoughts, and the comments of mymembers.  Thanks for sending us your letter.>>> Odds and Ends (_!_)@@@ Finish the Story ContestWell, there was only one response, and that was from Carl Imparato.Here is what Carl said,=0F\"Am I missing something?

It is YEWS-TUN a=ndit does not matter how people pronounce it in other places.=0F=07   Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere. Houston has its ow=nversion of traffic rules. Never forget that downtown Houston is composedentirely of one way streets. The only way to get out of center of townis toturn around and start over when you reach Dallas, Texas.=0F=07   All directions start with, \"Go down  Westheimer...\"=0F=07   Westheimer has no beginning and no end.=0F=07   It's impossible to go around a block and wind up on the street  yo=ustarted on. The Chamber of Commerce calls this a \"scenic  drive\".=0F=07   If you actually stop at a yellow light, you cannot be from Houston=.=0F=07   Kuykendahl Road can only be pronounced by a native, so do notattempt the phonetic pronunciation. People will simply tilt their headsto the right and stare at you.=0F=07   Construction on the Gulf Freeway is a way of life, and a permanentform of entertainment.=0F=07   Many bizarre sights can be explained simply by uttering the phrase=,\" Oh, we're in Montrose!!\"=0F=07   Construction crews aren't doing their job properly  unless theyclose down all lanes except one during rush hour.=0F=07   If  someone actually has their turn signal on, it was probably lef=ton at the factory where the car was made.=0F=07   White haired men driving red or silver sports cars will not obey a=nyknown traffic rule and cannot be expected to stop for red lights or stopsigns.=0F=07   All ladies with blue hair who drive Cadillacs or LincolnContinentals have the right of way.=0F=07   The above mentioned blue haired ladies also have a  legal right toturn right from a left lane or to turn left from a right  lane. YOU HAVEBEEN WARNED!=0F=07   Buying a  Houston street map is a waste of money since there isabsolutely no way that you can route yourself in such a manner as toavoid major road construction.=0F=07   Houston natives are so rare that they are listed on the endangeredspecies list. The few remaining specimens are kept in a controlledenvironment for their own safety.=0F=07   Sir\" and \"Ma'am\" are used by the person speaking to you if there's=aremote  possibility that you're at least 30 minutes older than they are.=0F=07   \"Sugar\" is a more common form of  address than \"Miss\". So is\"Honey\". Do not take offense. This is how southerners address grownwomen.=0F=07   In Houston we drink Coca-Cola  and Dr. Pepper. It is rumored thatother soft drinks are sold here, but no one will admit to knowing anyonewho actually drinks them.  So don't ask for any other soft drink.=0F=07   What you need to know when arriving at Bush IntercontinentalConcourse of any terminal.  Walking heels on your boots or walking shoesare advised.=0F=07   Never honk your horn at another car in Houston traffic.

    "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 10/03/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>WestgateEnclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the packageon San Marcos that you received earlier.If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?San MarcosThe property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is forsale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per squarefoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in WestSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexesand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  Thisproperty will have the best location for student housing of all newprojects, just as the duplexes do now.If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as thereis a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is notyet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I willknow more on this question later today.Sincerely,George W.

  "Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls": [
    "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/19/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austinthat we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realizethe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks asif she will be ok in the long run.George W.

In both cases, Alan Greenspan was chairman of the Fed andGeorge Bush was president. However, there are some major differences thistime.

We have built a business that is secure and reputable, with a client base of loyal users whose participation and feedback have helped us become what we are today.We want to go further and provide you with an even better place on the Internet to buy and sell wine. We want to add more features, make the site faster, and make it more secure. In order to do that, however, we have to begin charging a modest commission. Beginning with lots posted on Monday, November 5, 2001, sellers will be charged a 3% commission for all successful auctions. Bidding and buying will remain free - fees only apply to the seller. The new fees are the lowest in the wine auction industry - online or offline. Other wine auctions charge as much as 12% to the buyer AND 12% to the seller.1. Increased advertising to attract new members2. Enhanced customer service3. Platinum Seller Program - a way to reward sellers with proven track records4. Greater protection for buyers5. New ways to buy and sellWe believe the new charge to sellers is competitive and fair, and hope you agree. With this change, we are committed to providing you with the fastest and easiest method for selling and buying wine. Please continue to provide us with comments and suggestions on ways of enhancing our service. We value your membership and are grateful for your continued patronage and support.

The Commission also approved SCE and PG&E's motion to enterinto bilateral agreements and schedule those transactions through the PXusing the bilateral-option market.  These transactions will be confidentialand will be disclosed only to the Commission's energy division, for purposesof reasonableness.  The Commission did not act upon San Diego's advice letter(#1242) to facilitate customer awareness of competitive alternatives.  Thatadvice letter will not be acted upon until the next Commission meeting inSeptember.The Commission has also opened an investigation into the role of the utilityas a default provider and will explore how the utility should pass along itscosts to the customers.  It will also address whether SDG&E should beauthorized to participate in bilateral contracts in addition to PXpurchases.  It also opens the door to consider alternative exchange.  This isa fast track investigation, so I will set up a call to discuss early nextweek.Sandi McCubbin and I were in Sacramento yesterday meeting with several of thekey legislative offices.  There was also an interested party meeting (AB 1890Implementation Group).  From those meetings, it was apparent that Steve Peaceis interested in legislation to institute rate caps in San Diego, re-vamp thegovernance structure of the ISO and PX boards, having market participants(generators, marketers, utilities) share in some of the pain that San Diego'sconsumers feel, extend the rate freeze, etc.  Although, most of the otherlegislative offices saw this proposal as a total morass.The legislative offices that we met with, while interested in providing somepolitical cover to DeDe Alpert (Senator from San Diego in a close politicalrace), were not interested in pursuing sweeping changes to the currentstructure, although this could change.  However, it should be noted that DeDeAlpert said herself that she would introduce rate cap legislation in SanDiego when the legislature reconvenes on August 7.  Most of the discussionwith the other offices was on what can be done by next summer and focused onbringing on peaking plants and expanding demand responsive programs.Sandi and Dave Parquet also met with John Stevens, of the Governor's Office.He stated that the Governor did not want any major changes to the currentstructure to come across his desk, but that the Governor needed our help inpreventing such changes from getting there, otherwise he may be politicallycompelled to sign the legislation.  Sandi will send out more informationlater, she's having computer problems.There will be a hearing next week of the Senate and Assembly EnergyCommittees on San Diego issues on August 10.We, in GA, will keep you updated on developments."

  "Your \"Bridge\" corp./contract info request": [
    "Ali,The \"Bridge\" you referred to in your voice message to me is not the one youwant, I believe.  You referred to a $5MM spend by Enron w/ \"Bridge\".  Thatspend data comes from the pre-SAP era, and may not be as accurate as onemight hope.  In addition, you will find that the product/service category is\"Hardware\".  I am not sure that is the \"Bridge\" which Kathy Shaps is lookingfor the contract information (if any) on.That Bridge (Kathy's target, I believe) is the one which EBS has done a dealwith (Bridge/Savvis/EBS, early summer '00; for WebFN)...Jeannette Busse &Greg Reynolds are intimately familiar with that customer relationship, butperhaps not at the contract level.  If it is and EBS-only relationship, EBSmay have the only contract.  The EBS contracts contact would be Ray Stelly,who reports to Pat Weatherspoon (Ray is out until Monday the 11th, though).You might also check with Richard Weeks, who could direct you to the rightperson in EBS purchasing, if it's a \"buy on PO\" situation.sframeBust=undefinedPlease check the URLs above, and if they take you to the company with the\"Enron relationship\" you're referring to, I'll have a better idea what tolook for.  In the meantime, I am looking into our contracts area to see what,if any, contracts that GSS has active (for any part of Enron) with anycompany called \"Bridge\", whether it is Bridge Information Systems, or someother \"Bridge\".  When I have more information, I'll call and/or e-mail youwith an update.

I don't know if you recall, butduring our talk we conducted an exercise attempting to determine new usesfor tissue.  I was surprised to learn that Kimberly-Clark has just announceda new product.  They actually were holding a analyst conference call thismorning to discuss earnings and their new venture.  Your questions arecertainly very current!  I wish I had been creative enough to think of thisproduct during our interview.Here is the link.Y=/www/story/01-16-2001/0001404319&EDATE=Jan+16,+2001RY=/www/story/01-16-2001/0001404319&EDATE=Jan+16,+2001>Again, thank you for taking the time to interview me.

Is this a good idea to forward on the e-mail or is itoverkill given the e-mail I sent yesterday? Second, could I mention \"GaryKing\" Mike Rabon's Kinko's contact in the e-mail?Thanks for your suggestion!  SJHere are several \"touchpoints\" identified by Mike Rabon, the Enron BroadbandServices originator, which may facilitate your finding the appropriatebroadband solutions architect at Kinko's.  You may recall having met MikeRabon in the October 6th meeting.Kinko's has an IP network today with access to all branches.  Kinko's hadexpressed the need to add more hubs to that network and make some changes toit in the spring 2001 time frame.  Enron's goal would be to make a needsassessment for the desired structure that Kinko's would like to see as itNear term network planning.IP Transport - Capacity requirements for Mbps, and burst potential.IP Transit - Capacity requirements and current contract usage for internettransit. Kinkos.com in particular has a high potential for IP transitcapacity.Storage - As the hubs and branch numbers grow, there may be a need formanaged storage. Enron's solution will reduce, or eliminate the need to buystorage devices. Mike Rabon would like to speak with someone at Kinko's aboutyour storage strategy and growth.Collocation - There is a substantial opportunity for Enron to provide theactual space to be used for the hubs, as well as the IP transport from thehubs.Interactive Video - Enron's IPNet Connect product will allow high qualityH.323 video conferencing at bandwidths well above 768K. Utilizing the EnronIPNet Connect network installed to branches can allow video costs to besignificantly reduced, and allow much higher video quality.  Enron'sutilization of IP precedence will allow business traffic, internet trafficand video traffic to traverse the same network.  Mike Rabon would like tospeak to the Video Conferencing product manager.Risk Management - Enron's expertise in Risk Management needs to becommunicated to the proper person."

    "hi.. i know you are under tremendous pressure.  i'd like to help in any way possible to clean things up.. if you have not already completely gone down this path, i can help with the banks and marketers up here..i know all of them.  for example, we are loking at unwinding a 12 year deal CSFB has on with us. most of the banks hold reserve against specific deals.. this can increase depending on the counter.  in the case of csfb, this is certainly the case... it can also be in our best interest to get deals off if we are paying money out to the counter.. this is the case with catequil (hedge fund) who holds 23M of our money- we are paying them Libor but borrowing at Libor + 350..+ looking into all this because we can take some money.. also good to just clear up lines as this has been a major impediment to bigger deals this year.+ campbell- can you give me 5 minutes to give them comfort we can clear ANYTHING they want..market comment.. talking to pulaski today..put on the following through the floor today- strikes could be slightly different..jan02- short 5 calls, long 3.75 calls, short 2.75 puts- 1200 lotsjun02- long 2.75 puts, short 3.75 calls- 1500 lotsbasically playing small withdrawal scenerio in nov and dec and high end march storage.. wants to be max short summer but does not see big move till mid jan- willing to risk the 2.75 line on the jan options..seems contrary to what you've been talking about.. weak front, supported back...unless you do not see weakness till jan/feb...."

  "daily block forwards new charges": [
    "tim.belden@enron.com, robert.badeer@enron.commark.guzman@enron.commark.guzman@enron.comTalked to Mark Hodge from the PX this morning regarding the charges on ourstatement.  He said that the daily block forwards transaction fee has beenwaived for July and Aug. (.02 transaction charge).  However, the tariff waschanged on May 2nd that increased the settlement (aka clearing) charges to.03 per mwh per day.I asked him why the daily block forwards are so expensive when we get the .01charge as a preferred customer on the term block forwards.  He said it'sbecause of the costly bookout process.  I told him we do financial onlys, butnot bookouts, and restated that .03 is more expensive than brokers.  He saidthat because the tariff filing of .03 was the maximum, these fees can benegotiated away from the .03 max., especially since we don't add to the costsof bookouts.   So, whoever among us is the queen or king of daily blockforwards, or our block forward accounts in general, I suggest we do negotiatea lower rate on the daily schedules.Both Brett and I tried to access the tariff on the PX website, but wecouldn't read it.  So, if someone has better clearance or web tools than us,please let us know so we can update ours."

    "Please take me off your email listDear AEDC Member,One of the most interesting developments in the economic development arenais the creation of the AEDC/CUED/EDAC Site Selection Data Standard.  Thisstandard, long in the making, provides an opportunity for economicdevelopers and their customers to have one common means of presenting andexamining data.  Adoption of the standard promises real time savings andmore effective economic development decisions as communities will be morecomparable than ever before.A copy of the standards is attached so that you can take a look at it tosee how the data standards can be made to work for you.

That is slightly higher than the 895.8 billion kwhforecast by the agency last month.For the entire winter heating season of October throughMarch, electricity demand was forecast to rise by 4.6 percentfrom the previous year, the EIA said. The increase was drivenby the residential and commercial sectors, which were forecstto be higher by 8 and 4 percent, respectively.More electricity plants were expected to switch fromnatural gas back to fuel oil as oil prices drift lower, thegovernment report said.\"This trend is expected to continue through the firstquarter 2001,\" the EIA said. \"Although the favorable pricedifferential for oil relative to gas is expected to continuethrough the forecast period, by the second half of 2001,expected increases in gas-fired capacity are expected to keepgas demand for power generation growing.\"The monthly report also said that mild weather has easednatural gas prices in California, but the state still faces gassupply and deliverability bottlenecks affecting its electricityplants.California has been fighting all winter to maintain"

 seems ahad 4.5 bcf a day more demand.  that includes commercial residentialindustrial switching processing...as far as 2 bcf/d  power gen demand- that counts the fact that last year wasextremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year, west will berunning every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe5% still and hydro way down.  every molecule that can will flow west fromwaha this summer versus little last year.  east power prices really haventreached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to wheregas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand.  some concern ofmore efficient replacing less but hard to quantify.  we're trying to buildthe stack now to estimate.frac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors.  willcontinue coming back.  a little concerned about 2 oil prices.  borderingright there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise100,000 last week as gas got to parity.let me look into inj capability.  definitely bigger when field is empty fromengineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gendemand low and inj capacity lower...my initial thoughts.bo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now.  reallyinactive.to clarify, not raging bull.  i like everybody want to see what the injnumbers in april look like.  nobody putting a position on until that startsto clarify.  just think that hedging demand is making market a little shortright now making next move up more likely.  would be scale up seller thoughnot really sure why cash trades at 10-15 back.  doesnt make any sense.however as more fields start turning around throughout month, the stg arb togreat in my opinion to keep spread there.  must close one way or the other.notice that spread tightened to 6-8 towards end of trading friday?in general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here.  50cents lower and no switching, no processing, and gain back some demand.market needs to see some big stg numbers first.i think the best play right now is to start buying longer  term put spreads.Jan 4/3.5 look great to me.  if we get back to 2.8 and don't match lastyear's early weather, bombs away.this doesnt allow for new generation demand-which is unclear cuz it requirespower px, also doesnt accrue for more eficient gen replacing inneficient,weather of course. but 2bcf/d sounds hi-esp shudnt happen until loads peak injuly-shud be marginal in apr-junif you notice im not alot diff than your guys-4.6 demand destruction isimplied but im including a factor for R/C energy conservation-ie poor guyslikeme turning lites off and thermostat down-its making a difference- that will beless factor in shoulder demand months-reason why i think y on y s&d swing willbe closer to 5 bcf apr-jun, if px doesnt fall and electricity spikes i thinkwe'll see conservation return cuz i wont turn on my air cnditionernow rember the 7.4 is vs gas at sub 6.00 ie february which is approxwherewe are todayall that being said yes some demand has come back-but it is as i considerextraordinary demand destruction-those things which never really have occuredbefore-like the level for fuel switching in jan and fractionation margins(ieliquids) which were all non existent a year ago save for residual fuel. someammonia/fert prod  has come back as well. but when you get down to 2 -3 bcf/dindustrial in the more i think of it-may not be destruction anymore as muchaunction of an economic slowdown.anyway -i think i only know two guys that are bearish-me and one of yourbigfund customers(ospraie). we'll see.  is collins bullish as well-he seemsquieterin the mkt lately.heres another one-what you guys think the industry capacity for injection ison a weekly basis? we sud test it...in other words if the max is say 105 thenmeans the basis will uttery colpase on daily cuz mkt will keep futs too hi andbe unable to inject all the gas available? thotsalso, you any idea why cash at the hub alway seems to hold a 10-15 ctdiscount lately daily vs next month futs? why not 5 or 30 cts? i dont get itbtwondering if its transportation or storage cost related.have a good weekdn my man---------------------- Forwarded by Steve LaFontaine/GlobalCo on 03/03/2001i think you are done with hhd/cdd stuff -ie did you complete the cdds vsutilites demand?

    "very useful...thx.   keep me postedCaroline Abramo@ENRONFraser/HOU/ECT@ECTHi- all the funds are trying to figure out what the play is for next year-major divergence of opinions.  Most everyone we talk to takes a macro view.+ Dwight Anderson from Tudor thinks anything above $6 is a sale from theperspective of shut in industrial demand- he believes that between $6-7 noindustrial (basic industry type) can operate.  He tracks all the plantclosures similar to what Elena does in Mike Robert's group but it seems on amore comprehensive level (Jen- it would be good for fundamentals to trackthis number- do some scenario analysis on it under various economicconditions- like recession!!).  I will try to find out what his total numberfor turned back gas is- just ammonia is a little more than 1/2 Bcf which doesnot seem all that meaningful but the total may bring us back into balance forthe summer.While he's a seller above $6, he'd also be a buyer of summer at lower levelsHe firmly believes in increased production in 02 (still has 1.1 day short)based on his relationship with the producing community although I personallythink that 1Q02 sees little.  I know that the fundamentals group is trackingthese numbers from the producing community and has seen no increase in 3qover 2q and is doubtful for any in 4q over 3q.He really believes theories on products being out of whack- heat/gas,crude/propane....+ Jim Pulaski is a bull period- he really likes april and may on the 0storage scenario- I agree that we try to build storage in April but with thebackwardation out there what is the incentive??? as well, with lowerbaseloads for the summer- deliverability should not be an issue.  I am tornon this one.+ Catequil- new fund- Paul Touradji - used to be with Tiger- they do the sameanalysis as Dwight- just starting up and one of their mandates is to be longnat gas!! through vol or outright.+ Harvard- not really sure of the view yet- they have not been active in gasjust crude/products- they like buying cheap vol- because they do not have MTMissues- they like to look out in the calendar years.Moore Capital, Global Advisors, Caxton, Paloma Partners, Kingdon, Renaissance(program trader) - just so you know the names- as I get to know them better,I'll try to fwd on thoughts regularly.Have a great holiday!

    "Sizable staff of 245 lawyers in merger limboHOUSTON (AP) - The fate of Enron Corp.'s massive legal staff has been a subject of discussion amid talk of possible layoffs at the troubled energy trader.The company's legal staff size is larger than some law firms.\"We've always regarded them as one of the big law firms in Houston,\" said Howard Ayers, managing partner of Andrews&Kurth, one of the city's largest with about 240 lawyers in Houston.Enron has about 245 lawyers worldwide, company spokesman Vance Meyer said. With about 145 lawyers in Houston, if it were a private firm it would have been the city's sixth-largest, according to the Chronicle.Enron's internal law office has grown along with the huge trading firm, now set to merge with smaller but stronger Dynegy. As Enron's stock plummeted further, Dynegy last week denied rumors it might drop out and leave Enron to face possible bankruptcy.Speculation in the legal community runs the gamut from rumors that dozens of lawyers could be laid off as early as this week to the idea that Enron will hold on tightly to its talent.\"My guess is they'll need their lawyers while they get things in a more steady state. There's a lot of legal work to go through,\" said Joel Swanson, a senior partner at Baker&Botts, a law firm with about 265 lawyers in Houston.In addition to Enron's in-house legal staff, the company also has hired just about every large firm in Houston over the last few years."

EOL is great for funds like Ren whose traders get buy/sell orders at the beginning of the trade day (I assume they get signals on close) and have discretion on how to execute through the day. Versus Campbell who gets a signal and executes orders immediately regardless of liquidity.. its all to do with the way they view slipageLiz at Renaissance was not giving you the whole picture on how much they trade.. they are an 8 Billion fund.156,000 crude contracts- most in one day.. 6,000 contracts85,000 nat gas- 6,000 highest one day40,000 Nickel-1,000 highest one day120,000 Ali- 6,00052,000 Cu- 5,00024,000 Zn- 2,000The only other energy counterparty they have is Goldman (this is the case with a lot of the program traders).. they tried MS, but said they were terrible.."

    "I'm big seller of interventions.  they tend not to work.  if the gas market wants to go lower, enron coming out and buying 10,000 contracts is not going to stop the market from going down.  maybe in the short term, but that's it.  same with currencies.  ECB can come out and transfer some of its foreign reserves from dollars to Euros, but they are limited by their currency reserves unless they want to act in the futures market at which point they have to exit that position at some point.  i think it is more psychological than anything.  i think overall market interventions have been extremely ineffective.-----Original Message-----Here is a bio on my Business, Gov't & Int'l Economy prof.  He gave apresentation on the stuff he did for the European Central Bank the otherday.  He reviewed why historically everyone looks to germany (i.e. Bubba) asa proxy for determining monetary policy in Europe.  Moreover, he explainedwhy exchange rates were the focal point in determining monetary policy inGermany.  With the new ECB, the bank heads are explicitly trying to removepublic focus on exchange rates.  However, this effort may have led to thebelief by the financial community that the ECB does not care about/ will notdefend the euro.  He then stated that this is not true.  So, I'm thinkingthat downside is limited.  The performance of the euro has not goneunnoticed, especially given the critical EU goal of 2% inflation p.a.epHuw Pill is an Assistant Professor of Business Administration at theGraduate School of Business Administration, Harvard University, where heteaches the first year required MBA course Business, Government and theInternational Economy.Having attended University College, he received an undergraduate degree inPolitics, Philosophy and Economics from the University of Oxford in 1989.

    "me thinks the currency market has seen enough failed interventions that it shrugs off any intervention and may view it as a sign of weakness.  me also thinks that until foreigners quit plowing all their money into the US the dollar should remain fairly strong.  however, if all the hedge funds are short which i assume they would be, the turnaround will be very quick.-----Original Message-----i took macroecon also.  i'm not a proponent of open market interventions.  iam merely saying that its on the ecb radar screen and that measures will betaken to remedy a weak euro.  further, everything is psychological, asignalling effect to move the market up is fine by me.  i think overall YOUhave been extremely ineffective (just kidding, pooks).-----Original Message-----I'm big seller of interventions.  they tend not to work.  if the gasmarket wants to go lower, enron coming out and buying 10,000 contractsis not going to stop the market from going down.  maybe in the shortterm, but that's it.  same with currencies.  ECB can come out andtransfer some of its foreign reserves from dollars to Euros, but theyare limited by their currency reserves unless they want to act in thefutures market at which point they have to exit that position at somepoint.  i think it is more psychological than anything.  i think overallmarket interventions have been extremely ineffective.>  -----Original Message-----> 40ENRON@ENRON.com]>> Here is a bio on my Business, Gov't & Int'l Economy prof.

    "Agree with the first paragraph.Bets get tougher from here.  Not so obvious and require much larger size to get same juice.  Generally not a good position considering the current world order, or disorder.  Not much juice in gas basis either.  This is where we see whether we are good traders or just great fundamentalists.-----Original Message-----Is there any truth to my thoughts or am I showing my ignorance?I appreciate your feedback.ThanksFrank-----Original Message-----Looks like all the schedule C activity, we will make quarterly earnings.  That being said, we've lost a lot of cushion and I predict that fourth quarter we will carry some large VAR going into year end.  Let me know if you think we should revisit limits, particularly if we need to offer up to Lavo and crew the best bet for Enron's risk capital.As an aside, I think the best bet may be gas.  Regarding gas, I'm thinking the \"basis\" bet is probably more likely than huge NYMEX bet given current NYMEX level may not have enough juice to provide required profit, this being said both price and basis horizon don't appear to have much trading topography?  In East power, we are dog piling length in the Pennsylvania area, an area without a significant gas fired stacks, shorting the Midwest, net net ending up long.   In the West, shorts are still driving risk and in the words of Chuck Berry -how low can it go? Limbo alone suggest we have to hit the dirt sometime, it is trading sub $40 handleFrank"

Itwasn't even really cold.  That would have been the highest AGA # of the threeweeks by 15 bcf.Our guys are thinking 4.5 bcf/d.  Pira is saying that Feb as a whole averages3.5-4 bcf/d. That's just destruction and does not include new production, ifany.  Further Pira estimates that March destruction will be about half ofmore production, 2 bcf/d more gas generation demand.  Start with a 400 bdeficit and 200 injection days gets you to flat against last years storage incurrent price environment.   I think we are fairly priced fundamentally, butwith huge customer imbalance for hedging from buy side, surprises in themarket right now are to the upside in my view.

    "I think I should give you a little background on small ventures.  BillPerkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship.  He is anextremely creative individual.  Whalley actually commented on him today assomeone \"who thinks outside the box\".  Bill actually sat in a bar four yearsand said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth.  He has beensuccessful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas.As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron.  He throws outideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one.  He pointedout an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normallydon't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade forEnron.  In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades withinreason.  I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should beconsidered a high priority.  I am willing to accept some of the credit riskexposure as a cost of doing business.  Bill understands his role as anindependent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades forsomeone with finite capital.  I place very high confidence in Bill notconducting high risk trades.  Having said that, we certainly need to monitorhis credit exposure and continue to require LC's.  Just understand that he isat a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment gradecounterparty.I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spreadoption he traded.  He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on thetrading desk, knew it as well.  There are a couple isolated products thatEnron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations.  Thiswas one product.  Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricingmodels created by the research group.  The problem with these models is thatthey are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamentalprice limitations.  For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible,for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go withinvariable cost than the models predict.  Thus it is necessary to apply acorrelation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used.  Obviously,we have this function in our pricing models.  I was not aware thismethodology had not been transferred to the valuation models.  This has sincebeen changed.  Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as veryfew non-investment grade companies trade these types of products.Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure toEnron.  I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consultingcredit.  I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this tradeconsidering the circumstances.  If you believe differently, please advise.Thanks,John"

We have been trying to prove to Andersen that the value in the dual trigger option lies more in the price volatility than the physical plant outage.  AA was perplexed by the approximate 50% margin on these deals.  Larry Marcus pointed out to them that this isn't any different than an out of the money call option which would also typically generate a 50% margin.  They believe that it will greatly help our argument if they can verify with a trader that this is true.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.Mary-----Original Message-----David Hoog recommends that Jennifer and Patty talk with Harry Aurora.  K-----Original Message-----if a call option is way out of the money, such as the ones we purchased last summer, the premium is a multiple of the \"expected\" payout.  a trader may not respond well to the term \"margin\" because they dont calculate it. as an example, if the midmarket value for a $100 power call is $2.50, and a $500 call is expected to pay 40% as much, a trader would offer this illiquid instrument for $2, which would be like a 50% margin.  one problem with this analogy is that expected value of payout is frequently much lower than the midmarket because there are very few arbitrageurs in this market who can really take advantage of that.  this example does support the statement, but a trader will not think about it the same way.  they will not call this extreme vol smile on illiquid products a high margin.  harry arora would be the trader to talk to.-----Original Message-----Patty Grutzmacher and Jennifer Stevenson (both Andersen) were scheduled to review our pricing model with Tom Bauer (Andersen partner) this week.  Due to issues relating to the Enron shareholders' lawsuit,  Tom could not meet with them.   Patty and Jennifer did have further discussions with Amitava and Vasant.   They are all right with the model.Larry -Patty / Jennifer want to confirm your statement that a 50% margin on an out-of-the-money call option is not unusual.  They have asked Stacey White (Director of Power Risk Mgmt) to recommend a power trader with whom they can talk.  If you know of a person you would like them to talk with, please let me know.Mary Cilia (transaction support) has asked Jennifer and Patty not to push the issue with Tom Bauer until he is in a more receptive mood.

You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number isallowed, not an algebraic equation.Acquiring a CompanyIn the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means ofa tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's sharesthe value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oilexploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the veryviabilityof Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, thecompany under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But ifthe project succeeds, the value of the company under current managementcould be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 areconsidered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worthconsiderably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the companywill be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than underCompany T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share undereithermanagement.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value undercurrent management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under CompanyA,and so on.The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine thepricethey should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at aprofitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, thepotential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T todelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, thenaccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reachesthe press.Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the explorationprojectwhen submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results whendeciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T willaccept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value ofthe company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, forinstance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T isanything less than $50.As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over priceoffersin the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T'sstock?$______ per/share"

    "Thanks.  That is an interesting idea.  I'd like to keep the rear stairwaybut that might still be possible.  Anyway, let's see what happens with thevariance.  I appreciate your efforts.By the way, did you have any problems with any of the neighbors?Bob----- Original Message -----Bob,I turned in the application for a variance yesterday.  The hearing will beon January 8th.  In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing,the application had to be in by November 9th.  I was under the impressionthat yesterday was the deadline.  Sorry if I dropped the ball.On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some usefulsuggestions about the addition.   It might be possible to move the additionforward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the newspace.  You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and usethe new space for your game/play/music room.  Then you could close off theexisting play room to replace the bedroom lost.  Part of the play room thatis bordered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could beused for a built in desk with a couple of computers.  This way you wouldnot have to add a second staircase.  The walls needed to convert theplayroom to a bedroom should be minor construction.  In the back you couldslope the roof until you were within the setback.  Then you could place alarge dormer facing the back of the property or bring a wall straight up.>From the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as yourdrawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area belowthe addition.  The kitchen and dining room windows would still open to thedriveway but they would be more shaded.  That is the west side of the houseso that might not be a bad thing.  Your ideas about opening up the kitchento the living room or dining room would still be possible.  Personally, Ithink opening the dining room would be the better idea.I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested inexploring anything except your original plan.  But I wanted to suggestsomething in case the variance was not granted.  Let me know if you want meto try and sketch out these ideas.Phillip-----Original Message-----**********************************************************************This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate andmay contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of theintended recipient (s).
